    No epoch in Debian version
    
    Do not use the epoch in a package version (<num>: prefix)
    for the package name (that's also what dpkg-buildpackage does).

    docdir without package name
    
    With the traditional --docdir option it is not possible
    to select a path which does not include the package name
    and version. With this patch one can use
      --docdir=:<path>
      to select a directory that nothing gets appended to.

    Avoid hard-coded installation directory
    
    Instead of hard-coding /usr/local as installation directory,
    find out where the checkinstall script is actually located
    and find the other files relative to that:
    
    <prefix>/bin/checkinstall
    <prefix>/lib/checkinstall/...
    <prefix>/lib/installwatch.so

    Allow package creation without being root via fakeroot
    
    Note that the default location of checkinstall is not normally
    in PATH of normal users, so call it explicitly or set PATH:
       fakeroot /usr/local/sbin/checkinstall ...

Author: Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran <izto@asic-linux.com.mx>
Date:   Fri Nov 14 10:02:43 2008 -0600

    Added mknodat() support.
    
    Just like fstatat(), it requires us to define __xmknodat()

Author: Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran <izto@asic-linux.com.mx>
Date:   Fri Nov 14 01:24:50 2008 -0600

    Patch from Sebastien Vasey for permissions and symlinks issues.
    
    Fixes a permission issue that, for example would let a package created
    by checkinstall change the owner of a user's home directory to root. This is
    done by ensuring permissions are preserved at each step.
    
    An issue with symlinks is also fixed. The patch makes checkinstall
    dereference all symbolic links that are not created by the installation script,
    while the others are kept.

Author: Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran <izto@asic-linux.com.mx>
Date:   Fri Nov 14 01:01:37 2008 -0600

    Added linkat() support
    
    In instw_setpathrel():
     If dirfd is AT_FDCWD then we got nothing to do, return the path as-is
    
    In linkat():
    FIXME: If we have AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW we need to dereference the links

    Updated checkinstall version Id, minor debug message format fix for fopen()

Author: Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran <izto@asic-linux.com.mx>
Date:   Wed Nov 12 18:24:19 2008 -0600

    Added support for chownat() and fstatat()
    
    Included fstatat() support which in fact requires
    __fxstatat() and __fxstatat64(). Just like __xstat() and its relatives,
    they are the back-end for fstatat(), which in glibc is implemented as
    an inline function. See the details in sys/stat.h.
    
    While doing a strace of the chown utility I found out it calls chmod32()
    so I added a small hook to support it.

    I don't need it right now and it's causing segfaults when running checkinstall.
    I'll look into it later.

    Switch to git. Checkinstall pre 1.6.2

nov/01/2006

    * Provides/Requires bug fixed

    * Applied the patches from Felipe Sateler:

      - We now explicitly run bash (It has always benn a requiremente anyway)
      - In Debian we set the architecture with dpkg-architecture.
      - If we're creating a .dpkg then we eliminate uderscores and put
        dashes instead in the package name.
      - Tag all files in /etc inside the package as config files


june/23/2005 ====== Checkinstall 1.6.0 is released ======

    * Applied the PAGER patch from Tomas Pospisek

    * Changed the Provides/Requires option in the menu

    * Applied the "Copyright patch" from Andy Hanton to fix some issues
      with newer rpm versions. Also his buildroot patch

december/01/2004 ====== Checkinstall 1.6.0beta4 is released ======

    * CK_SLACKWARE, CK_REDHAT and CK_DEBIAN were being ignored if
      set in checkinstallrc. Fixed.

    * Fixed "libdirs: file not found"

    * Improved postinstall-pak handling
    
    * Fixed variable name typo: It said PROVODES instead of PROVIDES.
      Reported by Bernd Weigelt.
    
    * Cosmetic fix in "--help" output
    
    * Added command line flag "--addso".
    
    * The default for ADD_SO is now NO. So no more auto-editing of
      /etc/ld.so.conf unless explicitly requested.
    
    * Fixed detection of postinstall scripts (PINST_EXISTS bug)
    
    * Added MAKEPKG_FLAGS to checkinstallrc. By default sets flags useful
      to users of newer Slackware versions.

    * Added SHOW_MAKEPKG to checkinstallrc.
    
    * Fixed the famous "segfault on newer glibc's" bug in installwatch

december/25/2003
    * Fixed another "argument list too long" bug.

    * Merged in some suggestions from Tobias G: more docs filenames for 
      automatic inclusion in doc-pak and better handling of symlinks when
      copying the documentation files.

    * Added a "--reset-uids" option that resets the permissions of all
      files and directories to "755" and the owner and group of all 
      directories to root.root, in a way similar to what Slackware's
      makepkg prompts you to do.
      
    * Added a patch from Thomas Rausck to also add symlinked directories.
      
    * Fixed the support for recycling a pre-existing .spec file. Part of
      the fix was based on a patch sent by Karlheinz Pischke.
      
    * The PKG_GROUP variable is correctly set when using the -R, -S or -D
      command line options.
      
    * Added a "--fstrans" command line option for enabling or disabling
      the filesystem translation code.
      
    * Fixed the problem many people found when copying the documentation 
      files. Now the documentation and the included (With "--include") files
      are handled outside the installscript.sh script. This keeps the 
      filesystem translation code from messing with those.
      
    * The package information menu was moved to the first stages of the
      script. Now you can modify the package's name or version and the
      documentation directory will be correctly named.
      
    * Improved the domain name detection algorithm used when setting the
      "Maintainer" field. We start with the env variable HOSTNAME, then
       try running "hostname -f" and finally we default to "localhost".
      
    * A pre-existing .spec file will not be erased when checkinstall exits.
      
    * If a pre-existing slack-desc file is found then we use it to generate
      the description-pak file UNLESS we already have a description-pak file.
      
    * CheckInstall attempts to identify any ELF shared libraries in the
      package and append their locations to the /etc/ld.so.conf file, if 
      they are not already there.

december/14/2003
    * Fixed a small typo, reported by Andrej Lajovic.
    * Added default values that were missing for BASE_TMP_DIR, PAK_DIR,
      RPM_FLAGS and DPKG_FLAGS. Also fixed a bug that made checkinstall
      ignore the setting of INSTALLWATCH_PREFIX and INSTALLWATCH. Reported
      by Karlheinz Pischke.

november/28/2003
    * Fixed a problem in printf when the $format variable contained a "--"

march/28/2003
    * More echog() and echogn() modifications. They now properly escape
      asterisks and probably the rest of the special characters.
march/23/2003
    * Created two new echog() and echogn() functions for using gettext with 
      printf()-like formatting. All references in the script were modified
      for using these new functions.

march/16/2003
    * Applied another patch from Dmitry, this time to include directories
      in the .spec file when building rpm packages. The root directory is
      excluded, wich fixes the problem we had before that made us not including
      directories at all.

march/15/2003
    * Added a check to see if rpmbuild is in the PATH when we are 
      expecting it to be there.

march/13/2003 --- 1.6.0beta3 begins ---
    * Applied patches from Dmitry Vukolov for CK_DEBIAN and CK_REDHAT
      handling. Several patches for handling spaces in directories and
      a "$" that was not properly escaped in a warning message.

march/12/2003
    * Added version setting patch sent by Lawrie Abbott

    * Added new command line options "--rpmi" and "--rpmu" for telling 
      rpm to (i)nstall or (U)pdate new rpm packages.

    * In slackware, tar-1.13 is used if present (Fixes some issues when 
      building packages in newer Slackware versions).

    * Added command line option: "--with-tar" which can be used to manually
      specify the path to the tar binary to be used when building packages.

    * Fixed document directory handling

    * The MAKEPKG variable can now be set in the checkinstallrc file


march/11/2003
    * Merged in the patches from Dima Vukolov for erasing the temp .tgz file
      used when building a rpm package and finding the RPM source directory
      path using the %_topdir macro from rpm

    * Added Thomas Rausch's patches for symlink handling

november/27/2002
    * Added internationalization support via GNU gettext

november/24/2002

    * Added support for preinstall-pak, postinstall-pak, preremove-pak
      and postremove-pak scripts on both RPM and Debian packages. In Slackware
      the postinstall script was already supported as "install-pak".

    * Added support for inclusion of a custom list of files in the package,
      via the "--include" command line option. It takes a file as argument.
      That file should contain the list of files to be included, one per
      line.

    * Added the "--inspect" command line option. It allows you to view and
      optionally edit the list of files to be included in the package, before
      the package is created. Suggested by Max Norton.

    * Added the "--review-spec" and "--review-control" command line options that
      allow you to review the .spec or DEBIAN/control files when creating 
      .rpm or .deb packages, before the packages are created.

    * Merged in the patches sent by Max Norton for fixing some man page 
      handling bugs and to copy directories with special permissions.

    * The RPM packages now include directories so these should be also deleted
      when a .rpm package is removed.

      
november/23/2002

    * Added Olivier Fleurigeon's patches for support of the new installwatch
      0.7.0beta1, that allows us to do the whole installation procedure
      in an alternative root, therefore allowing to create a package 
      without actually installing it in the system. This functionality
      is invoked with the "--install=<yes|no>" command line option.

    * Added support for "--requires" for specifying package requirements
      for RPM packages. This patch was sent by Ulrich Baur.

october/26/2002

    * The rpmbuild program is used only if using rpm 4.x. Otherwise we still
      use "rpm -bb"

    * If there's an install-pak file, --ss is implied (Run the Slackware
      install script interactively)

september/10/2002

    * The user's umask is ignored and automatically set to "0022", unless the
      user explicitly request a custom umask value with the new "--umask" 
      command line option.
    * Added support for the new Slackware package description format. It
      can be activated with the "--newslack" command line switch.

august/25/2002

    * We use "rpmbuild -bb" instead of "rpm -bb", because newer rpm versions
      no longer support the use of "b" switches with the "rpm" program.
    * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.5.2. The description file for
      Slackware packages was not handled properly by the doinst.sh script.
    * The architecture string is set to "powerpc" when building a Debian 
      package. 

july/09/2002
    
    * Applied patch from Simon Munton for filtering out only the file names
      that begin with "/dev" and not every file name with "/dev" in it.

june/28/2002
    
    * Man pages under /usr/local are compressed too.

april/24/2002

    * Automatic man page compressing is now available when the "--gzman=yes" 
      command line option is selected. This includes code from the brb-compress
      script included in the rpm-4.0.2 distribution.
    * Various fixes and workarounds for the case when the source directory's 
      path contains white spaces. Read the BUGS file.

april/22/2002

    * Added "OpenLinux" to the list of possible locations for the rpm sources
      directory. Suggested by Michael v.Ostheim.
    * Added the "debianize" patch from Matt Hope. Now the .deb packages built
      with checkinstall should be a bit more Debian-standard-compliant.
    * The pager used by checkinstall can now be selected via the
      PAGER environment variable.
    * The pkgtool info display warning is now issued only if the Slackware
      packaging system is selected. Suggested by Acid Hippy.
    * If the Debian packaging system is selected, the package version is 
      verified to ensure that it contains at least one digit, otherwise dpkg
      would complain about it. Suggested by Uri David Akavia.
    * Another dpkg-friendly correction: the package name is forced to lower
      case, another thing demanded by dpkg  :-). Suggested by Simon Rutishauser.
    * Included a patch from Vladimir Bilyov to enable symbol stripping from 
      shared libraries. Use it carefully. Active only when "--strip=yes" and 
      "--stripso=yes" is selected.

december/22/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.5.1 is released ======
    * Modified the slackware package creation module to use the new
      (Post-Slackware 8.0) Slackware package naming scheme:
      name-version-architecture-release.tgz.
    * Added command line options: "--provides" and "--maintainer"

december/19/2001
    * Corrected the checkinstall.log creation to prevent it from being 
      overwritten with each file created.
    * Use "." instead of "*" to get all the files in a directory with tar,
      including any dot files found. Thanks to Tom for both of these.
    * Merged in the patch from Guglielmo Bondioni to add support for the
      "Mantainer:" field in the Debian control file.
    * Added support for the "Provides:" field in the RPM spec file. Sent by
      Uwe Koloska.
    * If "description-pak" and/or "doc-pak" are already in the source
      directory then checkinstall won't delete them when finished unless it is
      asked to. Suggested by Uwe Koloska.
      
november/27/2001
    * Added the "--nodoc" option to answer "no" to the question about including
      default documentation in the package.
    * Applied patches from Olivier Fleurigeon: getopt argument parsing and
      fix a bad behaviour when using "--backup=no" (checkinstall tought that
      the installation had failed).

november/23/2001
    * Applied the Paul Wagland patch for a DOC_DIR variable. Now you can
      specify the path where the package docs will be installed (instead of
      /usr/doc). I completed it with the "--docdir" command line option.
    * Corrected a tar invocation explicitly telling it to use stdout. Thanks 
      to George Sipe for noting it.

november/18/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.5.0 is released ======
    * Finally found the two other file descriptor leaks in installwatch
      that were still causing the "Too many open files" error when installing 
      huge packages.

november/13/2001
    * Added new checkinstallrc options: DPKG_FLAGS and RPM_FLAGS.
      RPMFLAGS is now deprecated. Use RPM_FLAGS instead.
    * Changed the format of the information displayed by "--help".

november/11/2001
    * Applied a patch to correctly name the Debian packages.
      This patch was sent by Guglielmo Bondioni <bond@linux.it>.
    * Now all the "Package information section" values can be set with 
      command line options. Suggested by Olivier Fleurigeon.

october/20/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.5.0beta2 is released ======
    * Fixed the "invalid option" problem with rpm.
    * Added support for a central package repository. If the "PAK_DIR" variable
      is set (It can be set in the checkinstallrc file) then checkinstall will
      attempt to create the directory named by PAK_DIR and save the newly
      created package instead of leaving it at the default location. Now you
      can automatically keep all your created packages in one single place  :)
    * There's a verification to check if the required binaries to build the
      selected package type are present. 
    * Miscellaneous changes: "debug: " is prepended to every debugging echo in
      the script, the yorn() function now uses lower case letters (cosmetic),
      etc. Make a diff to view details.

august/09/2001
    * Added a more robust way to create the .spec file's file list, it is now
      generated from the files found in the buildroot. No more duplicate files
      (or cuasi-duplicate like "/usr/local/file" and "/usr/local/./file").
    * The Slackware package name can now be changed in the Package Information
      menu. Now you can use a name different to the name of the source
      directory.
    * The "-y" command line option now also causes checkinstall to skip the
      package information menu. Now checkinstall is truly "scriptable".
    * When the "-y" option is specified the default answer is printed like if
      the user had typed it in. This is a cosmetic fix.

july/20/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.5.0beta1 is released ======
    * Started checkinstall-1.5.0 development. CheckInstall can now build
      Debian packages.
    * "-D" is now used to tell checkinstall to build a Debian package.
      "--type=debian" has the same effect.
    * The package info section is now common to all three packaging sections.
      If you use Slackware it won't be of much use (yet). One useful thing
      about it is that you can now change the name of the generated package
      so it can be different to the current directory's name.
    * Included the Slackware 8.0 makepkg patch in the "makepak" script. The
      patch will be effective only if a Slackware 8.0 installation is detected.


june/25/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.4.1 is released ======
    * Default values are assumed if checkinstallrc is missing
    * Merged in the tar patches from Sven Mueller
      Now tar is told to use stdin/stdout instead of just assuming it will.
    * Fixed the detection of an empty/nonexistent backup directory
    * "-bk" option is now actually used
    * Added the "--default" option to assume the default answers to all
      questions (useful for scripting). "-y" is a sinonym for "--default"
    * "--exclude" now can specify file names in addition to directory names.
    * The return status from the install command is now correctly reported.
      We were reporting "Installation succesful" even if the command returned
      an error condition.
    * INSTALLWATCH: Patched to fix the "Too many files open" problem that 
      some people reported. Thanks to Christian Tusche for this one.

june/08/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.4.0 is released ======
    * Added "--exclude" and "--autodoinst" options
    * Fixed a bug in the install command parsing
    * Fixed the backup code

april/19/2001 - Felipe Sanchez
    * Fixed an incorrect path to the checkinstallrc file.
    * cleanup() no longer deletes doc-pak, the spec file and the description
      file.
    * Fixed the "missing ']'" problem when testing the less pager.

april/17/2001 - Felipe Sanchez
    * Started development of checkinstall-1.4.0
    * Modified the installwatch library to backup files modified by the
      installation command _before_ they are modified. This is done at the
      system call level. CheckInstall now can backup those files and write for
      you a file containing them.

      See the RELNOTES file for details.

    * CheckInstall behavior is now fully configurable via command line flags.
      Try "checkinstall --help" to see them  =)

april/16/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.3.2 is released ======

    * Made a fix to avoid a possible symlink attack when creating the temp dir.
    * Fixed handling of filenames with spaces on them.

april/07/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.3.1 is released ======

    * When the Slackware package creation option is chosen a Slackware
      installation script is automatically created which will display the
      package description and put it in the package's log file in
      /var/log/packages, every time the package is installed with "installpkg".
    * Fixed the problem with rpm-4.0 about the "target" argument parsing.
    * Removed some macros from the RPM spec file, including the one that
      caused RPM to automatically gzip all man pages
    * ELF binaries are automatically stripped by default. This was copied from
      one of the rpm-4.0's scripts. I guess  that code is Copyrighted by it's
      author but has no Copyright notice in it. I'm assuming it's GPL'ed as
      a part of the rpm distribution.
    * Improved some features and added a few ones.
    * Included the patches suggested by Bernhard Kaindl
      - New temp dir  (/var/tmp)
      - No more dummy .tgz source file
      - Now all arguments are used as a single install command,
        no quotes needed.
    * Made some spelling corrections (Thanks to Sergei Kryaczevski)
    * RPM install flags are now customizable.

march/01/2001 ====== checkinstall 1.3.0 stable has been released ======

    * description-pak file format has changed. No more 
      "<name_of_your_package>-pak:" prefix on every line
      This gives us a more easier to write description-pak and fixes the
      colon-in-the-middle problem reported by Tobias Fritz.
    * Added options to control various defaults: 
         Package type
         Display of the output from the install command
         Package description
         Deletion of doc-pak, description-pak and .spec file

      Many of these were suggested by Chris Spiegel.

    * The yorn function has been largely extended to allow a default value
      to be specified and displayed, suggested by Sergey Kryaczevskih
    * The .spec file customization now correctly handles the case where you
      change the package's name, version or target architecture.
      This also fixes the LANG problems while detecting the actual created 
      package's name.
    * Fixed auto-detection of the rpm source directory
    * Fixed the duplicated files problem with rpm.
      Thanks to Ferdi Franceschini for this one.
    * Added debugging mode (see the description inside the script)
    * Re-organized the variables section in the script. I guess a rc file
      will come handy very soon..  ;-)
    * Patched installwatch so it can be compiled with glibc-2.2.1
      (Reported by Nicholas Young-Soares)

       BTW, I took over the development of installwatch; it's author is no
       longer reachable. 
    
jan/20/2001 by Felipe Sanchez

    * Fixed the nasty bug that prevented operation in nearly every rpm-based
      distribution
    * The BuildRoot for RPM package building  now points to a much saner place
      (The build dir inside the temp dir). Thanks to Chris Kuklewicz for the
      report.
    * Fixed the install script to make it actually report the exit status of
      the INSTALLCMD

    Thanks to all the people who reported bugs in the 1.3.0beta release!

jan/18/2001 by Felipe Sanchez

    * RPM package creation support is in place !
    * Now is possible to write multi-line descriptions

jan/12/2001 by Felipe Sanchez

    * Fixed bug which set incorrect (755) permissions to /tmp after the
      package was installed if the installation procedure created any files
      inside /tmp.
    * Fixed typo (chown instead of chmod, duh!) which made useless the security
      enhancements of the 1.2 release. Now the permission of the new temp dir
      ( /var/checkinstalltmp by default) should correctly be set to 700. If
      you used checkinstall 1.2 (now should be known as 1.2.0) then read the
      RELNOTES file to fix this.

      Thanks to Chris Spiegel for noting these two!
      
    * Changed checkinstall's versioning scheme: major.minor.patchlevel
    
jan/07/2001 by Felipe Sanchez

    * Fixed a couple of bugs which prevented symlinks from being added to the
      package and detection of files created inside scripts run by child shells.
    * Detection of the INT (ctrl-c) signal to allow for proper clean up and
      termination.
    * The package description file is now called "description-pak"

dec/10/2000 by Felipe Sanchez

    * Added the "okfail" function
    * Modified the program's look to be a bit more terse. I hope you like it.

dec/09/2000 by Felipe Sanchez <fsanchez@uagunix.gdl.uag.mx>

    * Added even more variables  :)
    * Reorganized temporary files structure under a common TMP_DIR, named
      after the process' ID to avoid problems with concurrent execution
    * Changed the yorn funcion (Yes or No) to return true for "Y" and
      false for "N"
    * Added an option to ignore files created under the source directory, 
      when these files where installed the owner of that directory (and
      it's parents) became root:root, a pretty annoying thing when this
      was your home directory  ;)
    * Modified Slackware's makepkg to avoid the questions about symlinks
      and permissions. The modified file is called "makepak".

nov/18/2000 by Kevin D. Knerr, Sr. <ld_barthel@yahoo.com>

    * Incorporated more variables to simplify the script & ease maintenance
    * Added ${} syntax to existing variables when concatenated w/ strings
    * Created a simple function to handle Y/N inputs
    * Added an option to let checkinstall create a basic set of package docs
      based on commonly used doc names
    * Reorganized some sections to improve program flow while reducing
      some instances of duplication
