2017-02-16  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	grep: don't forcefully strip carriage returns
	Commit 5c92a54 made the mistaken assumption that using fopen("rt")
	on platforms where O_TEXT is non-zero makes sense.  However, POSIX
	already requires fopen("r") to open a file in text mode, vs.
	fopen("rb") when binary mode is wanted, and at least on Cygwin,
	where it is possible to control whether a mount point is binary
	or text by default (using just "r"), the use of fopen("rt") actively
	breaks assumptions on a binary mount by silently corrupting any
	carriage returns that are supposed to be preserved.

	* src/grep.c (main): Never use fopen("rt") (Bug#25707).

2017-02-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Update TODO and doc
	* TODO: Bring up-to-date and fix formatting glitches.

	* doc/grep.in.1:
	* src/grep.c (usage): Clarify default input when -r.
	* src/grep.c (usage): Do not bother documenting egrep and fgrep;
	the manual is enough.

	grep: tune to avoid memchr2 sometimes
	Problem noted by Norihiro Tanaka in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grep-devel/2017-01/msg00027.html
	Although not enough to restore all the previous performance in the
	case he noted, it helps significantly.
	* src/kwset.c (memchr_kwset): Bring back small_heuristic,
	in a somewhat different form.

	* NEWS: Mention it.

2017-01-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: speed up Aho-Corasick when at most 2 bytes
	When using Aho-Corasick and all matched strings either begin with
	the same byte, or begin with one of at most two bytes, use memchr2
	to search for these matching bytes and apply the Aho-Corasick
	algorithm only when a memchr2 match is found.  On my platform,
	this speeds up 'grep -F -e aa -e ba in' by a factor of 7, where
	the file 'in' was created by 'seq -f %040.0f 10000000 >in'.
	* src/kwset.c (struct kwset.gc1): Now int, not char.
	If negative, there is no single terminal byte.  All uses changed.
	(struct kwset.gc1help): Now int, not char.
	If negative, memchr2 cannot be used.
	(kwsprep): Set up gc1 and gc1help from kwset->next, with
	the new (slightly changed) interpretation.
	(memchr_kwset): Use memchr2 if possible.
	Adjust to match new meaning of gc1, gc1help.
	(memoff2_kwset): Remove; no longer needed.
	(acexec_trans): Use memchr_kwset when possible, for speed.
	It now supersedes memoff2_kwset.

	grep: remove Commentz-Walter code
	This code was not being used, and complicated maintenance.
	We can bring it back from the repository if it turns out
	to be useful later.
	* src/kwset.c (struct kwset.reverse): Remove.  All uses of
	FOO->reverse replaced by (FOO->kwsexec == bmexec).
	(kwsalloc): Remove 'reverse' arg, as callers outside this
	module do not care about algorithm choice.  All callers changed.
	(kwsprep): When deciding whether to use Boyer-Moore, do not worry
	about being called twice on the same kwset, as that is not allowed.
	(cwexec): Remove; it was never called.  All uses removed.

2017-01-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	maint: avoid new syntax-check failures
	* src/kwset.c (struct kwset): Split a line longer than 80.
	* bootstrap: Update from gnulib. This fixes a new syntax-check
	failure due to its use of "time stamp".

2017-01-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Fix typo.

	* src/kwset.c: Fix comment typo.

	Improve -i performance in typical UTF-8 searches
	Currently ‘grep -i i’ is slow in a UTF-8 locale, because ‘i’ in
	the pattern matches the two-byte character 'ı' (U+0131, LATIN
	SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I) in data, and kwset handles only
	single-byte character translations, so grep falls back on a slower
	DFA-based search for all searches.  Improve -i performance in the
	typical case by using kwset when data are free of troublesome
	characters like 'ı', falling back on the DFA only when data
	contain troublesome characters.
	* src/dfasearch.c (GEAcompile):
	* src/grep.c (compile_fp_t):
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fcompile):
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pcompile):
	Pattern arg is now char *, not char const *, since Fcompile
	now reallocates it sometimes.
	* src/grep.c (all_single_byte_after_folding): Remove.
	All callers removed.
	(fgrep_icase_charlen): New function.
	(fgrep_icase_available, try_fgrep_pattern):
	Use it, for more-generous semantics.
	(fgrep_to_grep_pattern): Now extern.
	(main): Do not free keys, since Fexecute may use them.
	* src/kwsearch.c (struct kwsearch): New struct.
	(Fcompile): Return it.  If -i, be more generous about patterns.
	(Fexecute): Use it.  Fall back on DFA when the data contain
	troublesome characters; this should be rare in practice.
	* src/kwset.c, src/kwset.h (kwswords): New function.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

2017-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: prefer ptrdiff_t to size_t
	The code already cannot handle objects with size greater than
	SIZE_MAX / 2, so be more honest about it and use ptrdiff_t instead
	of size_t.  ptrdiff_t arithmetic is signed, which allows for more
	checking via -fsanitize=undefined.  It also makes the code a tad
	smaller on x86-64, since it can test for < 0 rather than for ==
	SIZE_MAX.
	* src/dfasearch.c (struct dfa_comp.kwset_exact_matches):
	(kwsmusts, EGexecute):
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fcompile, Fexecute):
	* src/kwset.c (struct kwset.kwsexec, kwsincr, memchr_kwset)
	(memoff2_kwset, bmexec_trans, bmexec, cwexec, acexec_trans)
	(acexec, kwsexec):
	* src/kwset.h (struct kwsmatch.index, .offset, .size):
	Prefer ptrdiff_t to size_t where either will do.

2017-01-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: improve comments, mostly in kwset
	Remove kwset.h comments that are obsolete and seemingly not
	maintained anyway; people can look in kwset.c instead.
	Update comments to reflect current behavior better.
	Cite Faro & Lecroq 2013.  Use GNU style for end-of-sentence.

2017-01-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	maint: update gnulib and copyright dates for 2017
	* gnulib: Update to latest.
	* all files: Run "make update-copyright".

2016-12-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: speed up -x with many patterns
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fcompile): Improve buffer allocation overhead
	with -x and multiple patterns.  In the common case where '\n' is
	the end-of-line byte, avoid copying other than the first and last
	patterns.

2016-12-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	gnulib: update to latest, fixing a parallel getopt test failure

2016-12-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	maint: space before paren

	grep: int cleanup in kwset.c
	This should affect only theoretical bugs with very large inputs.
	On my platform, this patch shrinks the grep text by 136 bytes.
	* src/kwset.c: Include intprops.h, for INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV.
	(struct trie, struct kwset, kwsalloc, kwsincr, treedelta, kwsprep)
	(bm_delta2_search, bmexec_trans, cwexec): Prefer ptrdiff_t to int
	when counts can exceed INT_MAX in large inputs, at least in theory.
	(hasevery): Use bool for booleans.
	(bmexec_trans): Avoid undefined behavior on integer overflow.

2016-12-27  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	grep: improve performance with multiple patterns
	* src/grep.c (main): Avoid fgrep-to-grep conversion for word matching
	with multiple patterns in single byte locales.

	grep: minor performance tweak for pure functions
	* src/search.h (wordchars_size, wordchar_next, wordchar_prev):
	Declare to be pure.

2016-12-25  Zev Weiss  <zev@bewilderbeest.net>

	grep: move localeinfo to grep.c
	It's not really dfasearch-specific, and grep.c initializes it, so it
	seems like the most appropriate "owner".

	* src/dfasearch.c (localeinfo): Remove.
	* src/grep.c (localeinfo): Add.
	* src/search.h (localeinfo): Move to new commented section.

2016-12-25  Zev Weiss  <zev@bewilderbeest.net>

	pcresearch: thread safety
	* src/pcresearch.c (pcre_comp): New struct to hold previously-global

	(jit_exec): Operate on a pcre_comp parameter instead of global state.
	(Pcompile): Allocate and return a pcre_comp instead of setting global
	variables.
	(Pexecute): Operate on a pcre_comp parameter instead of global state.

	kwsearch: thread safety
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fcompile): Return a kwset_t instead of setting a
	global variable.
	(Fexecute): Use a passed-in kwset_t instead of a global variable.
	(kwset): Remove global variable.

	dfasearch: thread safety
	* src/dfasearch.c (struct dfa_comp): New struct to hold

	* src/searchutils.c (kwsinit): Replace a static array with a
	dynamically-allocated one.

2016-12-25  Zev Weiss  <zev@bewilderbeest.net>

	grep: prepare search backends for thread-safety
	To facilitate removing mutable global state from search backends,
	compile() functions will return an opaque pointer to backend-specific
	data, which must then be passed back into the corresponding execute()
	function.  This is merely a preparatory step changing function
	signatures and call sites, so the pointers passed & returned are
	dummies for now and not (yet) actually used.

	* src/grep.c (compile_fp_t): Now returns an opaque pointer (the
	compiled pattern).
	(execute_fp_t): Now passed the pointer returned by a compile_fp_t.
	All call sites updated accordingly.
	(compiled_pattern): New static variable.
	* src/dfasearch.c (GEAcompile): Return a void pointer (dummy NULL).
	(EGexecute): Receive a void pointer argument (unused).
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fcompile): Return a void pointer (dummy NULL).

	(word_start): Remove, replacing with ...
	(sbwordchar): New static var.  All uses changed.
	(wordchar_prev): Return size_t, not bool, as this generates

	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute):
	* src/grep.c (main):
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute):

	grep: speed up -wf in C locale
	Problem reported by Norihiro Tanaka (Bug#22357#100).
	This patch improves the performance on that benchmark on my
	platform so that grep is now only about 2x slower than grep 2.26,
	which means it is considerably faster than grep 2.25 and earlier.
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute):
	Use wordchars_size to boost performance for this case.
	* src/search.h, src/searchutils.c (wordchars_size): New function.

	(wordinit, wordchars_count, wordchar_next, wordchar_prev):
	New functions.
	(mb_prev_wc, mb_next_wc): Remove.
	All callers changed to use the new functions instead.

	grep: simplify Fexecute
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Avoid the need for a 'try' local or
	for a 'goto success'.  Update mb_start to reflect newline found.

	grep: remove C label
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Remove label.

	maint: rewrite to avoid some macros
	These days, the dangerous powers of C macros are not needed if
	constants or functions will do just as well.
	* src/grep.c (SEP_CHAR_SELECTED, SEP_CHAR_REJECTED, SEP_STR_GROUP)
	(INITIAL_BUFSIZE):
	* src/kwset.c (DEPTH_SIZE):
	Now constants, not macros.
	* src/kwset.c (link): Remove macro. Instead, rename local vars
	from 'link' to 'cur'.
	(malloc) [GREP]: Remove macro.  All uses of malloc changed to xmalloc.
	Omit double-inclusion of xalloc.h.  Do not depend on 'GREP'.
	(U): Now a function, not a macro.
	* src/kwset.c, src/searchutils.c (NCHAR): Move this macro to ...
	* src/system.h: ... here, and make it a constant.

	New function, split out from fgrep_icase_available.
	(fgrep_icase_available): Use it.
	(try_fgrep_pattern): New function, which also uses it.
	(main): With two or more patterns, use try_fgrep_pattern to fix
	performance regression.  The number "two" here is just a heuristic.

	grep: simplify matcher configuration
	* src/grep.c (matcher, compile): Remove static vars.
	(compile_fp_t): Now takes a 3rd syntax argument.
	(Gcomppile, Ecompile, Acompile, GAcompile, PAcompile): Remove.

	Make 'name' a bit shorter.  New member 'syntax'.
	(matchers): Initialize it, and change removed functions to GEAcompile.
	(F_MATCHER_INDEX, G_MATCHER_INDEX): New constants.

	tests: use just-built grep in more places
	* cfg.mk (PATH): Prepend $(srcdir)/src, so that we use the just-
	built grep also when running commands like those of "make distcheck".
	This would have avoided the recently-luckily-noticed infloop bug.
	Tested by running this in a just-built directory:
	f=src/grep; printf '%s\n' '#!/bin/sh' 'sleep 9h' > $f; chmod a+x $f
	and then verifying that nearly every "make syntax-check" rule hangs.

	maint: tell "syntax-check" not to worry about the NEWS update

	* gnulib: Update to latest, for its new getprogname module.
	* bootstrap.conf (avoided_gnulib_modules): Include the getprogname
	module rather than the now-obsolescent progname.
	* src/grep.c: Include "getprogname.h" rather than "progname.h"
	and remove any use of set_program_name.
	* tests/dfa-match-aux.c (main): Likewise.
	* tests/get-mb-cur-max.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/grep.c (usage, main): Use getprogname() in place of program_name.

	omitted in a recent patch.)

2016-09-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: merge xalloc.h changes from Gawk
	* src/dfa.h (_GL_ATTRIBUTE_MALLOC): Define here, as other
	Gnulib .h files do.  This is more consistent with Gawk.
	* src/dfa.c: Include xalloc.h, since dfa.h no longer does so.
	Include localeinfo.h later; we don't care about order, but Gawk does.

	dfa: new option for anchored searches
	This follows up on a suggestion by Norihiro Tanaka (Bug#24262).
	* src/dfa.c (struct regex_syntax): New member 'anchor'.
	(char_context): Use it.
	(dfasyntax): Change signature to specify it, along with the old
	FOLD and EOL args, as a single DFAOPTS arg.  All uses changed.
	* src/dfa.h (DFA_ANCHOR, DFA_CASE_FOLD, DFA_EOL_NUL): New constants
	for dfasyntax new last arg.

	grep: update NEWS
	* NEWS: Describe previous change.

	grep: use regex fastmap unless -i
	This builds on a suggestion by Norihiro Tanaka (Bug#24009).
	* src/dfasearch.c (GEAcompile): Use a fastmap unless -i.
	This improves performance 20x for me using the first benchmark
	given in Bug#24009.

	grep: improve dfasearch storage management
	This patch is mostly refactoring, with a bit of performance tweaking.
	It is done in preparation for a fix for Bug#24009.
	* src/dfasearch.c (patterns): Now of type struct re_pattern_buffer *
	instead of an anonymous struct pointer, since there is no longer
	any need to keep regs here.  All uses changed.
	(GEAcompile): Use patlim instead of a hard-to-follow "total".
	Use x2nrealloc to avoid potential O(N**2) reallocation algorithm.
	Initialize just the pattern members that need clearing.
	(EGexecute): Put regs into a static variable, as this code did
	before 2001-02-18, as there is no need to have a separate set of
	regs for each pattern.  Explain the "Q@#%!#" comment better.

2016-09-01  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	dfa: remove separation by context in transition in non-UTF8 multibyte locales

	* dfa.c (transit_state): Avoid invalid character matching period.

	dfa: use single-byte algorithm even in non-UTF-8
	Even in non-UTF8 locales, if the current input character
	is single byte, we can use CSET to match ANYCHAR.
	* src/dfa.c (struct dfa): New member canychar.
	Cache index of CSET for ANYCHAR.
	(lex): Make CSET for ANYCHAR.
	(state_index): Simplify.
	(dfastate): Consider CSET for ANYCHAR.
	(transit_state_singlebyte, transit_state): Remove handling for eolbyte,
	as we assume that eolbyte does not appear at current position.
	(dfaexec_main): Use algorithm for single byte character to any single
	byte character in input text always.
	(dfasyntax): Initialize canychar.

2016-09-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: avoid code duplication with -iF
	This follows up on the -iF performance improvement (Bug#23752).
	* NEWS: Simplify description of -iF improvement.
	* src/dfa.c: Do not include wctype.h.
	(lonesome_lower, case_folded_counterparts): Move to localeinfo.c.
	(CASE_FOLDED_BUFSIZE): Move to localeinfo.h.
	* src/grep.c: Do not include wctype.h.
	(lonesome_lower): Remove.
	(fgrep_icase_available): Use case_folded_counterparts instead.
	Do not call it for the same character twice.
	Return false on wcrtomb failures (which should never happen).
	(fgrep_to_grep_pattern, main): Simplify.  Let fgrep_to_grep’s
	caller fiddle with the global variables.
	* src/localeinfo.c: Include <wctype.h>
	(lonesome_lower, case_folded_counterparts):
	Move here from src/dfa.c.  Return int, not unsigned int.
	Verify that CASE_FOLDED_BUFSIZE is big enough.
	* src/localeinfo.h (CASE_FOLDED_BUFSIZE): Now 32, so that
	we don’t expose lonesome_lower’s size.
	* src/searchutils.c (kwsinit): Return new kwset instead of
	storing it via a pointer.  All callers changed.  Simplify a bit.

2016-09-01  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	grep: speed up -iF in multibyte locales
	In a multibyte locale, if a pattern is composed of only single byte
	characters and their all counterparts are also single byte characters
	and the pattern does not have invalid sequences, grep -iF uses the
	fgrep matcher, the same as in a single byte locale (Bug#23752).
	* NEWS: Mention it.
	* src/grep.c (lonesome_lower): New constant.
	(fgrep_icase_available): New function.
	(fgrep_to_grep_pattern): Simplify it.
	(main): Use them.
	* src/searchutils.c (kwsinit): New arg MB_TRANS; all uses changed.

	strcmp(a,b) == 0.

	gnulib: update to latest

2016-08-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: make dfa.c fully thread-safe
	This follows up on Zev Weiss’s recent patches to make the DFA code
	thread-safe (Bug#24249).  It removes the remaining static
	variables used by dfa.c.  These variables are locale-dependent, so
	they would cause problems in multithreaded code where different
	threads are in different locales (e.g., via uselocale).  I
	abstracted most of the variables into a new localeinfo module.
	* src/Makefile.am (grep_SOURCES): Add localeinfo.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Add localeinfo.h.
	* src/dfa.c: Include localeinfo.h.
	(struct dfa): Remove multibyte member, as it is now part of
	localeinfo.  New members simple_locale and localeinfo.
	Put locale-related members at the end.
	(mbrtowc_cache): Remove; now part of dfa->localeinfo.
	(charclass_index): Rename back from dfa_charclass_index,
	since it's private.
	(unibyte_word_constituent): New arg DFA; use its sbctowc member.
	(using_utf8, dfa_using_utf8, init_mbrtowc_cache, check_utf8):
	Remove; now done by localeinfo members.  All uses changed.
	(dfasyntax): New localeinfo arg.  Move to end to avoid forward decls.
	Initialize the entire DFA.
	(unibyte_c, check_unibyte_c): Remove; now in simple_locale member.
	(using_simple_locale): Now takes bool instead of DFA.
	Do the locale check here, rather than in the caller,
	as the result is now cached in dfa->simple_locale.
	(dfaalloc): Just allocate the DFA.  dfasyntax now initializes it.
	* src/dfa.h: Add forward decl of struct localeinfo.
	Adjust to new dfa.c API.
	* src/dfasearch.c (localeinfo): New var, replacing former static
	vars like mbrtowc_cache.
	* src/localeinfo.c, src/localeinfo.h: New files.
	* src/search.h: Include localeinfo.h.
	(localeinfo): New decl.
	* src/searchutils.c (mbclen_cache, build_mbclen_cache):
	Remove.  All uses changed to localeinfo.
	* tests/Makefile.am (dfa_match_aux_LDADD): Add localeinfo.o.
	* tests/dfa-match-aux.c: Include localeinfo.h.
	(main): Adjust to changes in DFA API.

2016-08-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest
	This should fix Bug#24323 reported by Dennis Clarke, where grep
	does not build on Solaris 10 when compiled with Solaris Studio 12.4.

2016-08-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: minor thread-safety cleanups
	* src/dfa.c (struct lexer_state): Rename lexptr to ptr and lexleft
	to left, for brevity.  All uses changed.
	(struct dfa): Rename lexstate to lex and parsestate to parse,
	for brevity.  All uses changed.
	(using_simple_locale): Simplify boolean expression.
	(FETCH_WC): Parenthesize uses of dfa macro arg.
	(FETCH_WC, parse_bracket_exp, addtok_mb): Prefer suffix operators
	on structure members when possible, for clarity.
	(parse_bracket_exp): Check for buffer exhaustion before
	dereferencing buffer pointer.
	(struct lexptr): New type.
	(push_lex_state, pop_lex_state): Use it.  Change from macros
	PUSH_LEX_STATE and POP_LEX_STATE to static functions, and add
	parameters to make them proper C functions.  All uses changed.
	(lex): Simplify tests for \) and \|.  Avoid some string
	duplication by using &"^..."[boolean].
	(dfaalloc): Use xzalloc, not xcalloc with 1.

2016-08-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: minor tweaks of initial buffer alloc
	* src/grep.c (main): Allocate input buffer only when about
	to do I/O.  Avoid int overflow on systems with 2 GiB pages.
	Fix size_t overflow check.

2016-08-20  Zev Weiss  <zev@bewilderbeest.net>

	dfa: constify some function parameters
	* src/dfa.c (char_context): Mark dfa parameter const.
	(charclass_context): Likewise.

	dfa: thread-safety: initialize mbrtowc_cache in dfa_init
	* src/dfa.c (dfasyntax): Remove initialization of mbrtowc_cache.
	(init_mbrtowc_cache): New function.
	(dfa_init): Call it.
	http://bugs.gnu.org/24259

	dfa: thread-safety: eliminate static local variables
	* src/dfa.c: Replace utf8 and unibyte_c static local variables with
	static globals initialized by a new function dfa_init() which must be
	called before any other dfa*() functions.
	(dfa_using_utf8): Rename using_utf8() to dfa_using_utf8() for
	consistency with other exported functions.
	* src/dfa.h (dfa_using_utf8): Rename using_utf8() to dfa_using_utf8();
	also add _GL_ATTRIBUTE_PURE.
	(dfa_init): New function.
	* src/grep.c (main), tests/dfa-match-aux.c (main): Call dfa_init().
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute): Replace using_utf8 with dfa_using_utf8.
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Likewise.
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pcompile): Likewise.

	dfa: thread-safety: move regex syntax configuration into struct dfa
	* src/dfa.c: move global variables holding regex syntax configuration
	into a new struct (`struct regex_syntax') and add an instance of it to
	struct dfa.  All references to the globals are replaced with
	references to the dfa struct's new member.  As a side effect, a
	`struct dfa' must be allocated with dfaalloc() and passed to
	dfasyntax().
	* src/dfa.h (dfasyntax): Add new struct dfa* parameter.
	* src/dfasearch.c (GEAcompile): Allocate `dfa' earlier and pass it to
	dfasyntax().
	* tests/dfa-match-aux.c (main): Pass `dfa' to dfasyntax().
	http://bugs.gnu.org/24259

	dfa: thread-safety: move parser state into struct dfa
	* src/dfa.c: move global variables holding parser state (`tok' and
	`depth') into a new struct (`struct parser_state') and add an instance
	of it to struct dfa.  All references to the globals are replaced by
	references to the dfa struct's new member.
	http://bugs.gnu.org/24259

	dfa: thread-safety: move lexer state into struct dfa
	* src/dfa.c: move global variables holding lexer state into a new

	struct dfa.  All references to the globals are replaced with
	references to the dfa struct's new member.

2016-08-19  Zev Weiss  <zev@bewilderbeest.net>

	dfa: thread-safety: remove dfa.c's "dfa" global
	Remove the global dfa struct.  Instead, add a struct dfa pointer
	parameter to each function that had been using the global.
	* src/dfa.c (dfa): Remove file-scoped global.
	(charclass_index): Remove now-unnecessary function.
	(using_simple_locale): Add a dfa parameter and update all callers.
	(FETCH_WC, parse_bracket_exp, lex, addtok_mb, addtok): Likewise.

2016-08-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: tune list_files conversion to enum
	* src/grep.c (grepdesc): Use a slightly more-efficient way to test
	list_files.

	grep: prefer bitwise to short-circuit when shorter
	* src/grep.c (skip_devices, initialize_unibyte_mask, fillbuf, main)
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Prefer bitwise to short-circuit ops
	when they are logically equivalent and the bitwise ops generate
	shorter code on GCC 6.1 x86-64.
	* src/grep.c (get_nondigit_option, parse_grep_colors):
	Use c_isdigit instead of spelling it out with a short-circuit op.

2016-08-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: use 64-bit when ulong is at least that wide
	* src/dfa.c (charclass_word): Now unsigned long instead of unsigned.
	(CHARCLASS_WORD_BITS): Now 64 on 64-bit platforms.
	(CHARCLASS_PAIR, CHARCLASS_INIT): New macros.
	(CHARCLASS_WORD_MASK): Now a static const, since it no longer
	needs to be a macro.
	(equal): Open-code rather than calling memcmp.
	(add_utf8_anychar): Use CHARCLASS_INIT.

	dfa: avoid uninitialized constants
	Some compilers warn about 'static int const x;' on the grounds
	that X should have an initializer.  Instead of worrying about
	this, rewrite to avoid this sort of thing.
	* src/dfa.c (emptyset): New function.
	(parse_bracket_exp): Use it instead of 'equal' and a zero constant.
	* src/dfasearch.c (struct patterns): Remove tag 'patterns'.
	(patterns0): Remove zero constant.
	(GEAcompile): Use memset instead of the zero constant.

2016-08-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	maint: avoid new "make syntax-check" failure
	* src/dfa.c: Adjust comment not to go past column 80.

	tests: pcre-jitstack: avoid false failure without base64 -d support
	* tests/pcre-jitstack: Try harder to find a base64 decoder:
	try 'base64 -d', 'base64 -D', 'openssl base64 -d' and perl's
	MIME::Base64 decode_base64.  The old code would fail at least on
	OS X, for which base64 expects -D or --decode.

2016-08-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: minor refactoring and doc fixes
	* NEWS: Improve description of recent change.
	* src/dfa.c: Improve commentary.  Indent new code (and some
	long-existing howlers) more in GNU style.
	(dfa_state): Reorder members to make struct smaller on x86.
	mb_trindex member is now state_num, not size_t, so that -1 is more
	natural; all uses changed.
	(struct dfa): Similarly for mb_trcount member.
	(state_index): Compute values for new state components before
	allocating the state, to make the code easier to understand.
	(state_index, dfastate): Prefer A & ~B to other forms like (A & B)
	!= A.
	(dfastate, build_state, transit_state): In new code, prefer i++ to
	++i in for-loop control.
	(build_state, transit_state): In new code, prefer < to >.
	(transit_state): Add to *PP in one assignment, rather than in a
	loop.  Prefer !x to x == NULL.  Use xmalloc instead of xnmalloc,
	since the size is a constant.  Do the size calculation as a signed
	integer constant expression, so that the compiler diagnoses any
	overflow.
	(transit_state, free_mbdata): Tune by looping from -1 to N - 1,
	rather than from 0 to N - 1 with a separate instance for -1.
	(dfaexec_main): Rewrite to avoid side effects in if-part.
	(free_mbdata): Simplify.

	dfa: port to C90
	* src/dfa.c (transit_state, dfa_supported, dfamust):
	Don't use declarations after statements.
	If I recall correctly, gawk still wants to port to C90.

	dfa: fix context newline confusion
	* src/dfa.c (transit_state): Fix "... & ~0" that was evidently
	intended to be "... & ~1".  Do index calculation in a simpler way,
	that uses just addition (Bug#21486).

2016-08-16  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	dfa: improve leading "." with non-UTF8 multibyte
	In non-UTF8 multibyte locales, matching the dot expression is very
	slow, as the next state is calculated on demand.  This change caches
	the result for the typical case (Bug#21486).

	Compare the run times of this command before and after this change,
	on a i5-4570 CPU @ 3.20GHz using rawhide (~fedora 22) and compiled
	with gcc 5.1.1 20150618:

	(struct dfa): New members mb_trans, mb_trcount.
	(state_index): Initialize new members of struct dfa_state and calculate
	dependency on context of next character for positions for dot.
	(dfastate): Calculate follows positions for dot if enabled.
	(realloc_trans_if_necessary): Allocate transition tables.
	(build_state): Use new constant and reset transition tables.

	* tests/backref-multibyte-slow: When redirecting the "fast" LC_ALL=C
	run's output to /dev/null, we got an artificially low timing (of 0),
	due to grep's own stdout-vs-/dev/null optimization.  With an initial
	timing of 0 on that first run, the derived timeout for the UTF-8 run
	(which redirects to a file) would be a mere 1 second.  The fix: also
	redirect that first run's output to a file, not to /dev/null.

	grep: print "filename:lineno:" in invalid-regex diagnostic
	Determining the file name and line number is a little tricky because
	of the way the regular expressions are all concatenated onto a newline-
	separated list.  By the time grep would compile regular expressions,
	the <filename,lineno> origin of each regexp was no longer available.
	This patch adds a list of filename,first_lineno pairs, one per input
	source, by which we can then map the ordinal regexp number to a
	filename,lineno pair for the diagnostic.

	* src/dfasearch.c (GEAcompile): When diagnosing an invalid regexp
	specified via -f FILE, include the "FILENAME:LINENO: " prefix.
	Also, when there are two or more lines with compilation failures,
	diagnose all of them, rather than stopping after the first.
	* src/grep.h (pattern_file_name): Declare it.
	* src/grep.c: (struct FL_pair): Define type.
	(fl_pair, n_fl_pair_slots, n_pattern_files, patfile_lineno):

	grep: use Aho-Corasick algorithm to search multiple fixed words
	Searching multiple fixed words, grep used the Commentz-Walter
	algorithm, but this was O(m*n) and was very slow in the worst case.
	For example:

	  - input: yes `printf %040d` | head -10000000
	  - word1: x0000000000000000000
	  - word2: x

	This change instead uses the Aho-Corasick algorithm to search multiple
	fixed words.  It uses a high-quality trie-building function that is
	already defined for Commentz-Walter in kwset.c.

	I see 7x speed-up even for a typical case on Fedora 21 with a 3.2GHz i5
	by this change.  Using best-of-5 trials for the benchmark:

	    find /usr/share/doc/ -type f |
	    LC_ALL=C time -p xargs.sh src/grep -Ff /usr/share/dict/linux.words >/dev/null

	The results were:

	    real 11.37  user 11.03  sys 0.24  [without the change]
	    real 1.49   user 1.31   sys 0.15  [with the change]

	* src/kwset.c (struct kwset): Add a new member 'mode'.
	(kwsalloc): Use it.
	All callers are changed.
	(kwsincr): Using Aho-Corasick algorithm, build tries in normal order.
	(acexec_trans, acexec): Add a new function.
	(kwsexec): Use it.

	mb-non-UTF8-performance: avoid FP test failure on fast hardware
	* tests/mb-non-UTF8-performance: Don't use a fixed size.
	Otherwise, on a fast system, the fixed-size unibyte test
	would complete in a nominal 0 ms, which might well be
	smaller than 1/30 of the multibyte duration, provoking
	a false positive test failure.  Instead, increase the
	size of the input until we obtain a unibyte duration of
	at least 10ms.

	doc: mention unibyte encoding fix
	* NEWS: Document recent fix for encoding errors in unibyte locales.

	grep: improve unibyte -P performance
	This is a followon to the recent changes prompted by Bug#20526.
	In <http://bugs.gnu.org/bug=20526#86> Norihiro Tanaka pointed out
	that grep mistakenly assumed that unibyte locales cannot have
	encoding errors.  Here, the mistake hurt performance significantly.
	On Fedora 23 x86-64 in the C locale, this patch improved grep's
	performance by a factor of 7 when run as "grep -P 'z.*a'" on the
	output of "yes $(printf '\200\n') | head -n 1000000000".
	* src/pcresearch.c (multibyte_locale) [HAVE_LIBPCRE]: New static var.
	(Pcompile): Set it.
	(Pexecute): Use it to avoid the need to call
	buf_has_encoding_errors in unibyte locales.

2016-01-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve on fix for Bug#22181
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pexecute): Update subject when skipping past
	easily-determined encoding errors, as this is faster than letting
	pcre_exec skip them.  On my platform this improves performance
	4.7x on a benchmark created via "yes $(printf '\200\200\200\200
	\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200x\n')
	| head -n 1000000 >j; grep -oP y j" in a UTF-8 locale.  Rework
	code that deals with PCRE_ERROR_BADUTF8 return, to avoid an
	incorrect (albeit currently harmless) 'bol = false' assignment.

	grep: restore -P optimization (followup fix)
	* src/search.h (EGexecute, Fexecute, Pexecute):
	Change decls to match new implementations.
	I forgot to add this file to the previous commit.

	grep: restore -P PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK optimization
	On my platform in the en_US.utf8 locale, this makes 'grep -P "z.*a" k'
	220x faster, where k is created by the shell command:
	yes 'abcdefg hijklmn opqrstu vwxyz' | head -n 10000000 >k
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute):
	* src/grep.c (execute_fp_t):
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute):
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pexecute):
	First arg is now char *, not char const *, since Pexecute now
	temporarily modifies this argument.
	* src/grep.c, src/grep.h (buf_has_encoding_errors): Now extern.
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pexecute): Use it.  If the input is free of
	encoding errors, use a multiline search and the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK
	option, as this is typically way faster.  This restores an
	optimization that was removed with the recent changes for binary
	file detection.

2016-01-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix calculation of unibyte_mask
	* src/grep.c (initialize_unibyte_mask): The old method worked for
	UTF-8 and other typical encodings, but did not work for weird
	encodings, e.g., one where all bytes other than 0x7f and 0x80 are
	unibyte characters.

2016-01-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: fix bug with with invalid unibyte sequence
	This was introduced by the recent binary-data-detection changes.
	Problem reported by Norihiro Tanaka in: http://bugs.gnu.org/20526#86
	* src/grep.c (HIBYTE, easy_encoding, init_easy_encoding): Remove,
	replacing with ...
	(uword_max, unibyte_mask, initialize_unibyte_mask): ... this new
	constant, static var, and function.  All uses changed.  The
	unibyte_mask var generalizes the old local var hibyte_mask, which
	worked only for encodings where every byte with 0x80 turned off is
	a single-byte character.
	(buf_has_encoding_errors): Return false immediately if
	unibyte_mask is zero, not whether the current encoding is unibyte.
	The old test was incorrect in unibyte locales in which some bytes
	were encoding errors.
	* tests/pcre-z: Require UTF-8 locale, since the grep -z . test now
	needs this.  Use printf \0 rather than tr.  Port the 'grep -z .'
	test to platforms where the C locale says '\200' is an encoding
	error.  Use cmp rather than compare, as the file is binary and
	so non-GNU diff might not work.
	* tests/unibyte-binary: New file.

	dfa: speed up handling of long pattern
	DFA tries to find a long sequence of characters that must appear

	Error-handling improvement suggested by Mike Frysinger in:
	http://bugs.gnu.org/16757#29
	* NEWS: Document pkg-config changes.
	* README-prereq: pkg-config is now a prereq when building from
	repository.
	* m4/pcre.m4 (gl_FUNC_PCRE): Report an error if pcre is explicitly
	requested but not available.  Defer to user-supplied PCRE_CFLAGS
	and PCRE_LIBS.

	build: remove typo and don't bother with /usr/include/pcre
	Problem reported by Holger Bruenjes.
	* m4/pcre.m4: Remove test for /usr/include/libpng (a typo).
	Come to think of it, don't bother worrying about
	/usr/include/pcre, as hosts with that problem can use pkg-config
	or configure with CFLAGS by hand.

	build: use pkg-config (if available) to configure libpcre
	Problem reported by Mike Frysinger in: http://bugs.gnu.org/16757
	* bootstrap.conf (bootstrap_post_import_hook):
	Copy pkg-config's pkg.m4.
	* configure.ac: Invoke PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.
	* m4/pcre.m4 (gl_FUNC_PCRE): Rewrite to use pkg-config if
	available, and to test that pcre_compile can be linked to.
	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CFLAGS): Add PCRE_CFLAGS.
	(grep_LDADD): Add PCRE_LIBS.
	* src/pcresearch.c: Simply include <pcre.h> if HAVE_LIBPCRE,
	since 'configure' arranges for the appropriate -I option now.

	grep: output "." file name in diagnostic
	This is bug C as reported by David Grayson in:
	http://bugs.gnu.org/16444#18
	This bug occurs only in obscure circumstances, and I didn't see
	how to write a reasonable test case for it.
	* src/grep.c (filename_prefix_len): Remove, replacing with ...
	(omit_dot_slash): New static var.  All uses of the former replaced
	with uses of the latter.
	(grepdirent): Don't add 2 if the filename is just ".".

	egrep, fgrep: just use what's in PATH
	* src/egrep.sh: Don't monkey with PATH; just use whatever 'grep'
	is in the path.  This is simpler, and lets the user specify
	default options with a script for only grep, with no need for
	egrep and fgrep scripts.
	Fixes: bug#19998

	doc: give a script wrapper example
	* doc/grep.texi (Environment Variables): Give an example of a
	wrapper script, as an alternative to using GREP_OPTIONS.
	Fixes: bug#19998

	maint: use ASAN-poisoning more carefully
	The ASAN-poisoning instituted by commit v2.21-14-g1555185 was
	incomplete, since the poisoned tail of the read buffer could well
	be the target of a legitimate follow-on read.  To accommodate that,
	we must unpoison each such region just before beginning fillbuf's
	read loop.
	* src/grep.c [HAVE_ASAN] (asan_poison): Define.
	(clear_asan_poison): Define.
	(fillbuf): Clear before reading, since we are likely to read
	into memory that was poisoned on the preceding iteration.
	* tests/two-files: New file, to test for this.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2015-01-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	tests: add support for ASAN memory poisoning
	This lets us reliably detect with ASAN some UMR bugs
	that would otherwise be detectable only some of the time
	with MSAN.  Use __asan_poison_memory_region to mark the unused
	portion of a read buffer as inaccessible.  Then, with ASAN,
	any attempt to access those bytes results in an ASAN abort.
	* src/system.h: Include "ignore-value.h".

	grep -F: fix a heap buffer (read) overrun
	grep's read buffer is often filled to its full size, except when
	reading the final buffer of a file.  In that case, the number of
	bytes read may be far less than the size of the buffer.  However, for
	certain unusual pattern/text combinations, grep -F would mistakenly
	examine bytes in that uninitialized region of memory when searching
	for a match.  With carefully chosen inputs, one can cause grep -F to
	read beyond the end of that buffer altogether.  This problem arose via
	commit v2.18-90-g73893ff with the introduction of a more efficient
	heuristic using what is now the memchr_kwset function. The use of
	that function in bmexec_trans could leave TP much larger than EP,
	and the subsequent call to bm_delta2_search would mistakenly access
	beyond end of the main input read buffer.

	* src/kwset.c (bmexec_trans): When TP reaches or exceeds EP,
	do not call bm_delta2_search.
	* tests/kwset-abuse: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	* THANKS.in: Update.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

	Prior to this patch, this command would trigger a UMR:

	  printf %0360db 0 | valgrind src/grep -F $(printf %019dXb 0)

	  Use of uninitialised value of size 8
	     at 0x4142BE: bmexec_trans (kwset.c:657)
	     by 0x4143CA: bmexec (kwset.c:678)
	     by 0x414973: kwsexec (kwset.c:848)
	     by 0x414DC4: Fexecute (kwsearch.c:128)
	     by 0x404E2E: grepbuf (grep.c:1238)
	     by 0x4054BF: grep (grep.c:1417)
	     by 0x405CEB: grepdesc (grep.c:1645)
	     by 0x405EC1: grep_command_line_arg (grep.c:1692)
	     by 0x4077D4: main (grep.c:2570)

	See the accompanying test for how to trigger the heap buffer overrun.

	Thanks to Nima Aghdaii for testing and finding numerous
	ways to break early iterations of this patch.

	dfa: avoid invalid match or infinite loop in unused matching mode
	Neither grep nor gawk uses this DFA code in its matching mode,
	since each always calls dfacomp with a nonzero final argument.
	However, when used in that mode, it had bug:
	After failing to match in matching mode, it should return NULL,
	but instead would either report a false match or enter an

	return NULL, rather than transitioning to the next state.
	* tests/dfa-match: Add a new test.

	tests: sjis-mb: remove now-obsolete and failing sub-tests
	* tests/sjis-mb: Commit v2.18-123-geb3292b changed how grep
	handles patterns with encoding errors.  These SJIS tests are
	skipped so often that we didn't notice until now that there were
	two tests of that changed behavior, and that on any system with
	the ja_JP.SHIFT_JIS locale, they would always fail.  Remove those
	two tests, since this functionality is well tested separately,
	via tests/prefix-of-multibyte.

2014-11-20  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	grep -F could erroneously fail to match in non-UTF8 multibyte locales
	This fixes a bug that can strike only when using a non-UTF8 multibyte
	locale like ja_JP.SHIFT_JIS.

	Consider this example: it would mistakenly fail to match before
	this patch:

	  printf '\203AA\n'|LC_ALL=ja_JP.SHIFT_JIS src/grep -F A

	When searching for a single byte that happens to be the latter
	byte of a multibyte character, and the target byte also follows
	that multibyte character, grep -F would advance an internal pointer
	by one byte too many, thus missing the target byte.  A test case
	for this bug is already included in tests/sjis-mb.

	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Skip one byte less, after matched middle of a
	multi-byte character.  Introduced by commit v2.18-119-gfb7d538.

	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Correctly compute the length of a match

	the "line" by both prepending and appending an EOLBYTE to the search
	pattern.  Here, we must correct for that.  However, to compensate,
	when we are using -x (--line-regexp) and start_ptr is NULL, we have

	Reported by Shlomi Fish in: http://bugs.gnu.org/18806
	Commit 9fa500407137f49f6edc3c6b4ee6c7096f0190c5 (2014-09-16) is a
	hack that I put in to speed up 'grep -P'.  Unfortunately, not only
	is it violation of modularity, it's also a bug magnet, as we have
	found out with Bug#18738 and Bug#18806.  Remove the optimization
	instead of applying more bandaids.  Perhaps we can think of a
	better way of doing the optimization, or perhaps we can just live
	with a slower grep -P (as -P is inherently slower anyway...).

	dfa: process all MBCSET constructs via glibc's matcher
	The DFA matcher does not support collating symbols or equivalence
	classes, so ensure that any MBCSET reference is handled by the glibc
	matcher.  dfa.c already handled this in one case, but not the other,
	so that a command like "printf '\0' |src/grep -aE '^\s?$'" would
	mistakenly end up using dfa.c's match_mb_charset function rather
	than glibc's matcher.

	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec_main): Move that code into the
	State_transition macro.  This renders the match_mb_charset
	unused by grep.

	grep: don't check extensively for invalid prefix bytes unless -P
	Problem reported by Jim Meyering in: http://bugs.gnu.org/18454#56
	* src/grep.c (grep): After the first buffer is checked, leave the
	file-type checker in TEXTBIN_UNKNOWN state only when -P is used.
	Only the -P matcher has performance problems with checking binary
	data that make it worthwhile to check every prefix input byte so
	the -P matcher's TEXTBIN_UNKNOWN optimizations can come into play.
	Other matchers can simply check the data directly, and using
	TEXTBIN_UNKNOWN with them slows 'grep' down for no benefit.

	grep: scan for valid multibyte strings more quickly

	(fillbuf): Don't bother with SEEK_DATA if it defaults to SEEK_SET.

	grep: skip past holes efficiently
	Take advantage of the relaxed rules for treating non-text bytes in
	binary data, by efficiently skipping past holes on platforms
	supporting lseek's SEEK_DATA flag.
	On one test on a circa-2008 Sun Fire V40z running Solaris 11.2,
	'grep x' took 0.009 real-time seconds to scan a holey file of size
	9,223,372,036,854,775,802 bytes, for a nominal scan rate of 1 ZB/s.
	grep 2.20's scan rate on this platform was 843 MB/s, so this is a
	speedup by a factor of 1.2 trillion.  The speedup factor is not
	as great on GNU/Linux hosts, due to what appear to be SEEK_DATA
	inefficiencies, but presumably this will be cleared up in time.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/grep.c, src/grep.h (eolbyte): Now char, not unsigned char.
	This is for compatibility with the rest of the code.

	* src/grep.c (skip_nuls, skip_empty_lines, seek_data_failed):
	New static vars.

	dfa: fix off-by-one under-allocation from recent change
	Commit v2.19-10-gc32ff67 mistakenly made this change:
	  -realloc_trans_if_necessary (d, 1);

	(dfaexec): Call realloc_trans_if_necessary and build_state directly.

	dfa: revert "grep: do not count newline before the start of buffer"
	This reverts commit 5dc3af2806d21455b818be3f9da26c372e4a7f8d.
	The previous change renders that commit unnecessary.

	dfa: do not clear the first state of a transition table
	If number of DFA states reaches 1024, build_state clears transition
	tables to save memory.  However, the initial state is always used,
	so clearing it just wastes time.
	* src/dfa.c (build_state): Do not clear the initial state's

	This bug was masked in the other GNU/Linux tests I made.  It was
	exposed on RHEL 6.5 x86-64, where the compiler (GCC Red Hat 4.4.7-4)
	happened to use temporaries in a different way.

	them already, and it's the same module as we are.
	Suggested by Aharon Robbins in: http://bugs.gnu.org/17458

	dfa: fix bug with \< etc in multibyte locales
	Problem reported by Stephane Chazelas in: http://bugs.gnu.org/16867
	* NEWS: Document the fix.
	* src/dfa.c (dfaoptimize): Remove any superset if changing from
	UTF-8 to unibyte, and if the pattern has no backreferences.
	(dfassbuild): In multibyte locales, treat \< \> \b \B as
	backreferences in the DFA, since the DFA relies on unibyte
	tests to check them.
	(dfacomp): Optimize after building the superset, so that
	dfassbuild can depend on d->multibyte.  A downside is that
	dfaoptimize must remove supersets that are likely slower than the
	DFA after optimization, but that's been done in the
	above-described change.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove word-delim-multibyte,

2014-05-09  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	grep: retry DFA superset after matching multiple lines
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute): Without this patch, the code reverts
	to KWset when the DFA superset matches multiple lines.
	However, if the DFA superset matches multiple lines, it most likely
	also matches a single line, and reverting to KWset means dfafast
	won't work effectively.  Change the code so that it retries the DFA
	superset immediately after it matches multipline lines.  On my platform
	this improves the performance of "LC_ALL=C grep '\(ab\)cd\1d' k" from
	3.48 to 2.14 seconds realtime, where k contains the output of
	"yes abcdabc | head -50000000".

	dfa: fix inconsistency in multibyte locales
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Use the same exit condition in multibyte
	locales as in unibyte.

2014-05-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	maint: mark some breakless cases with /* fallthrough */ comment

	dfa: assume C89 for CHAR_BIT
	* src/dfa.c (CHARBITS): Remove.  All uses replaced by CHAR_BIT.
	(NOTCHAR): Now an enum, since it need not be a macro.

	dfa: don't assume unsigned int is exactly 32 bits wide
	Sun C 5.12 (sparc) warns of the potential unportability.
	* src/dfa.c (charclass_word): New type, for clarity.
	All relevant uses of 'unsigned' changed.
	(CHARCLASS_WORD_BITS): Rename from INTBITS.  All uses changed.
	Now an enum, since it needn't be a macro.
	(CHARCLASS_WORD_MASK): New macro.
	(CHARCLASS_WORDS): Rename from CHARCLASS_INTS.  All uses changed.
	(setbit, clrbit): Cast 1 to charclass_word, for clarity.
	(notset, add_utf8_anychar, dfastats):
	Don't assume unsigned int is exactly 32 bits wide.
	(dfastate): Don't rely on implementation-defined conversion of
	greater-than-INT_MAX unsigned to int.  Change bit test to resemble
	tstbit more.

	maint: fix indenting to pacify 'prohibit_tab_based_indentation'
	* src/dfa.c: Use spaces and not tabs to indent some lines.

	grep: simplify and clarify invert-related code
	* src/grep.c (out_invert, prtext): Use bool for booleans.
	(prline): Remove unnecessary '!!' on a value that is always 0 or 1.
	(prtext): Remove last arg NLINESP; use !out_invert instead.  All uses
	changed.  Move decls to nearer uses, since we can assume C99 here.
	Update 'outleft' and 'after_last_match' here; it's simpler.
	(grepbuf): Compute return value by subtracting new from old 'outleft',
	rather than by keeping a separate running total.  Avoid code duplication
	by arranging for prtext to be called from one place, not three.

	(wordchar): New static function.
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute):
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Use the new functions, so that the
	code works correctly if a multibyte character adjacent to the
	match has two or more bytes.
	* src/search.h, src/searchutils.c (mb_prev_wc, mb_next_wc):
	New functions.
	* tests/word-delim-multibyte: Add a test for grep -w (which now
	passes), and a test for \> (which still fails).  The \< test also
	still fails.

	grep: improve internal API for multibyte boundary
	* src/search.h, src/searchutils.c (mb_goback): Rename from
	is_mb_middle.  Omit last arg.  Return number of bytes to go back,
	not just a boolean.  All uses changed.
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute):
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Adjust to API change.
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Eliminate common subexpression.

	grep: fix encoding-error incompatibilities among regex, DFA, KWset
	This follows up to http://bugs.gnu.org/17376 and fixes a different
	set of incompatibilities, namely between the regex matcher and the
	other matchers, when the pattern contains encoding errors.
	The GNU regex matcher is not consistent in this area: sometimes
	an encoding error matches only itself, and sometimes it
	matches part of a multibyte character.  There is no documentation
	for grep's behavior in this area and users don't seem to care,
	and it's simpler to defer to the regex matcher for problematic
	cases like these.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/dfa.c (ctok): Remove.  All uses removed.
	(parse_bracket_exp, atom): Use BACKREF if a pattern contains
	an encoding error, so that the matcher will revert to regex.
	* src/dfasearch.c, src/grep.c, src/pcresearch.c, src/searchutils.c:
	Don't include dfa.h, since search.h now does that for us.
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute):
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): In a UTF-8 locale, there's no need to
	worry about matching part of a multibyte character.
	* src/grep.c (contains_encoding_error): New static function.
	(main): Use it, so that grep -F is consistent with plain fgrep
	when the pattern contains an encoding error.
	* src/search.h: Include dfa.h, so that kwsearch.c can call using_utf8.
	* src/searchutils.c (is_mb_middle): Remove UTF-8-specific code.
	Callers now ensure that we are in a non-UTF-8 locale.
	The code was clearly wrong, anyway.
	* tests/fgrep-infloop, tests/invalid-multibyte-infloop:
	* tests/prefix-of-multibyte:
	Do not require that grep have a particular behavor for this test.
	It's OK to match (exit status 0), not match (exit status 1), or
	report an error (exit status 2), since the pattern contains an
	encoding error and grep's behavior is not specified for such
	patterns.  Test only that KWset, DFA, and regex agree.
	* tests/prefix-of-multibyte: Add tests for ABCABC and __..._ABCABC___.

	* src/dfa.c (dfambcache, parse_bracket_exp): Simplify.
	(mbs_to_wchar, wctok, FETCH_WC, match_anychar, match_mb_charset)
	(check_matching_with_multibyte_ops, transit_state_consume_1char)
	(transit_state, dfaexec): Use wint_t, not wchar_t, so that
	WEOF is treated correctly on platforms where WEOF is not a valid
	wchar_t value.
	(ctok, lex): Use int, not unsigned int, for characters,
	so that EOF is treated more naturally.
	(parse_bracket_exp): Use NOTCHAR to mark uninitialized char, since
	FETCH_WC can now set the char to EOF.
	(lex): Remove unnecessary test for EOF.
	(parse_bracket_exp, atom): Swap then and else parts, to put
	the small one first; this is more readable here.
	* src/searchutils.c (is_mb_middle): Simplify.

	tests: improve coverage for prefix-of-multibyte
	* tests/prefix-of-multibyte: Also test the regex version.

2014-04-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	kwset: speed up by using memchr2
	Idea suggested by Eric Blake in: http://bugs.gnu.org/17229#43
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add memchr2.
	* src/kwset.c: Include stdint.h, for uintptr_t.  Include memchr2.h.

	(bmexec): Use new members instead of recomputing their values.
	Increase advance_heuristic; it's just a guess, but memchr2 probably
	makes it reasonable to increase it.

	kwset: improve performance when large Boyer-Moore key doesn't match
	* src/kwset.c (bmexec): As a heuristic, prefer memchr to seeking
	by delta1 only when the latter doesn't advance much.

	dfa: fix index bug in previous patch, and simplify

2014-04-26  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	grep: speed up for a case to repeat failure in DFA after success in kwset
	A DFA is typically much faster if it is unibyte and does not set BACKREF.
	Skip kwset if the DFA is fast.  For example:

	    yes abcdabc | head -50000000 >k
	    env LC_ALL=C time -p src/grep -i 'abcd.bd' k

	This improved real-time from 4.86 to 1.34 s.

2014-04-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: omit static variables that limited dfaexec to one struct dfa
	Problem reported by Aharon Robbins in: http://bugs.gnu.org/17328
	* src/dfa.c (struct dfa): New member mbs.
	mb_follows is now a position_set, not a pointer to one;
	this simplifies memory allocation.  All uses changed.
	(mbs_to_wchar): Put DFA arg at the end, in place of the mbstate_t *arg,
	since the DFA now contains an mbstate_t.  All uses changed.
	(mbs): Remove static variable.

	in a unibyte locale.
	* src/kwset.c (memchr_trans): New function.
	(bmexec): Use it.  Simplify the code and remove some of the
	confusing gotos and breaks and labels.  Do not treat glibc memchr
	as a special case; if non-glibc memchr is slow, that is lower

	gnulib.

2014-04-22  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	grep: speed-up by using memchr() in Boyer-Moore searching
	memchr() of glibc is faster than seeking by delta1 on some platforms.

2014-04-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	kwset: simplify Boyer-Moore with unibyte -i
	This change doesn't significantly affect performance on my platform,

	* src/kwset.c (BM_DELTA2_SEARCH, LAST_SHIFT, TRANS):
	Remove these macros, in favor of ...
	(tr, bm_delta2_search): New functions.  All uses changed.
	The latter function is inline because this improves code size and
	runtime CPU slightly on x86-64 with gcc -O2 (GCC 4.9.0).
	(bmexec): Prefer tr when that's simpler.

2014-04-21  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	grep: speed-up for exact matching with begline and endline constraints.
	dfamust turns on the flag when a state exactly matches the proposed one.
	However, when the state has begline and/or endline constraints, turns
	off it.

	This patch enables to match a state exactly, even if the state has
	begline and/or endline constraints.  If a exact string has one of their
	constrations, the string adding eolbyte to a head and/or foot is pushed
	to kwsincr().  In addition, if it has begline constration, start
	searching from just before the position of the text.

	* src/dfa.c (variable must): New members `begline' and `endline'.
	(dfamust): Consideration of begline and endline constrations.
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfamust): New members `begline' and `endline'.

2014-04-17  Norihiro Tanaka  <noritnk@kcn.ne.jp>

	dfa: speed up by checking multibyte characters on demand
	If dfaexec() runs in non-UTF8 locales, length and wide character
	representation are checked for all characters of a line in a input
	string.  However, if matched early in the line, results for remaining
	characters are wasted.

	This patch checks multibyte characters on demand.  It should work
	faster for early matches, and reduces memory requirements.

	* src/dfa.c (struct dfa): Remove members mblen_buf, nmblen_buf,
	inputwcs, ninputwcs.  All uses removed.
	(buf_begin, buf_end, prepare_wc_buf): Remove.  All uses removed.
	(SKIP_REMAINS_MB_IF_INITIAL_STATE): Remove.  This is now expanded

	(resetmust): Null out zeroth entry of array.

	dfa: avoid duplicate strlen when allocating memory
	* src/dfa.c (dfamust): Use xstrdup, not strlen (twice) + xmemdup.

	dfa: simplify memory allocation
	* src/dfa.c (icatalloc, freelist, enlist, comsubs, addlists, inboth)
	(dfamust): Don't worry about null arguments or results,

	dfa: simplify position set and element count allocation
	* src/dfa.c (dfaanalyze): Allocation position set info all at one go,
	and similarly for element count info.

	dfa: simplify multibyte_prop allocation
	* src/dfa.c (struct dfa): Simplify by removing nmultibyte_prop;
	it should always be the same as talloc.  All uses changed.

	dfa: simplify range char allocation
	* src/dfa.c (struct dfa): Simplify by allocating one array of ranges
	rather than one for range starts and another for range ends.
	All uses changed.

	dfa: simplify transition table allocation
	* src/dfa.c (struct dfa): Remove member 'realtrans', as it can
	be computed from 'trans'.  All uses changed.
	(realloc_trans_if_necessary): Move earlier, to avoid a forward decl.
	Use x2nrealloc to compute new size, rather than doing it by hand,
	which omits a check for unlikely overflow.
	(realloc_trans_if_necessary, dfafree): Adjust to the fact that
	d->trans now might be either NULL, or 1 + the pointer to free.
	(build_state, build_state_zero): Use realloc_trans_if_necessary
	instead of duplicating its code.

	dfa: better size-overflow check
	* src/dfa.c (dfasuperset): Let xnmalloc do the multiplication,
	to check for size arithmetic overflow better.

	dfa: avoid unnecessary work and other initialization
	* src/dfa.c (dfaanalyze, dfainit):
	Don't bother allocating when x2nrealloc will do it for us.
	(dfastate): Allocate grps and labels on the stack, as their
	size is known at compile time.
	(build_state): Use xmalloc, not xnmalloc, since the multiplication
	can be done at compile-time.

	dfa: clarify memory allocation and port to IRIX
	This change was prompted by a porting problem:
	IRIX defines its own MALLOC macro, which clashes with ours.
	More generally, the MALLOC etc. macros are confusing, as they
	look like functions but do not have C-function semantics.
	A functional style makes the code easier to read, and though
	it lengthens the code a bit here it'll make other

	All uses replaced by xnmalloc etc.
	(REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY): Remove; all uses replaced by ....

	The superset of a DFA is like the DFA, except that for speed
	ANYCHAR, MBCSET and BACKREF are replaced by (CSET full bits) STAR,

	  original: a b CAT c CAT BACKREF CAT
	  superset: a b CAT c CAT CSET STAR CAT  (The CSET has all bits set.)
	If a string matches a DFA, it matches the DFA's superset.

	Without this change, compilation of dfa.c failed on OS X 10.8.5 with

2014-02-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	revert "grep: DFA now uses rational ranges in unibyte locales"
	The correct course of action for grep is to defer range interpretation
	to regex, because otherwise you can get mismatches between regexes with
	backreferences and those without.

	For example, [A-Z]. will use RRI but ([A-Z])\1 won't, with the confusing
	result that the first regex won't match a superset of the language
	described by the second regex.

	The source of the confusion is that, even though grep's dfa.c was changed
	to use range checking instead of strcoll, that code is only invoked if
	dfaexec is called with backref = NULL, and that never happens for grep!

	In the end, all that's needed for RRI is compiling --with-included-regex,
	and in that case the patch is almost a no-op.  Almost, because there
	are corner cases that aren't handled correctly (e.g. [a-[.e.]], or
	regular expressions that include a NUL character), but this can be
	handled separately.

	speed up mb-boundary-detection after each preliminary match
	After each kwsexec or dfaexec match, we must determine whether
	the tentative match falls in the middle of a multi-byte character.
	That is what our is_mb_middle function does, but it was expensive,
	even when most input consisted of single-byte characters.  The main
	cost was for each call to mbrlen.  This change constructs and uses
	a cache of the lengths returned by mbrlen for unibyte values.
	The largest speed-up (3x to 7x, CPU-dependent) is when most
	lines contain a match, yet few are printed, e.g., when using
	grep -v common-pattern ... to filter out all but a few lines.

	grep: make --ignore-case (-i) faster (sometimes 10x) in multibyte locales
	These days, nearly everyone uses a multibyte locale, and grep is often
	used with the --ignore-case (-i) option, but that option imposes a very
	high cost in order to handle some unusual cases in just a few multibyte
	locales.  This change gets most of the performance of using LC_ALL=C
	without eliminating the ability to search for multibyte strings.

	With the following example, I see an 11x speed-up with a 2.3GHz i7:
	Generate a 10M-line file, with each line consisting of 40 'j's:

	    yes jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj | head -10000000 > k

	Time searching it for the simple/noexistent string "foobar",
	first with this patch (best-of-5 trials):

	    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 env time src/grep -i foobar k
	        1.10 real         1.03 user         0.07 sys

	Back out that commit (temporarily), recompile, and rerun the experiment:

	    git log -1 -p|patch -R -p1; make
	    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 env time src/grep -i foobar k
	        12.50 real        12.41 user         0.08 sys

	The trick is to realize that for some search strings, it is easy
	to convert to an equivalent one that is handled much more efficiently.
	E.g., convert this command:

	  grep -i foobar k

	to this:

	  grep '[fF][oO][oO][bB][aA][rR]' k

	That allows the matcher to search in buffer mode, rather than having to
	extract/case-convert/search each line separately.  Currently, we perform
	this conversion only when search strings contain neither '\' nor '['.
	See the comments for more detail.

	dfa: fix multibyte character in brackets with repetition
	Let FOO stand for any multibyte (e.g. CJK character) in the regexp.
	It turns out the following much simpler regexp:
	        ([^.]*[FOO]){1,2}
	is sufficient to cause the crash.

	In the first step of its parsing, DFA transforms regexp from human
	readable syntax into reverse-polish form.  For regexps of the form a{m,n}
	repeat counts, it simply builds repeated copies of the representation
	of a, with appropriate inserted CAT and QMARK operators.  For the above
	example with a regexp of the form a{1,2} it would build:

	        <RPN representation for a>
	        <RPN representation for a>
	        QMARK
	        CAT

	When building repeated copies of RPN representations, additional
	copies of the RPN representations are made by calling a function
	copytoks() with arguments consisting of the start position and
	length of the original copy.

	The problem is that the current code for copytoks() is simply
	incorrect.  It operates by calling addtok() for each individual
	token in the source range being copied.  But, in the particular
	case that the token being added is MBCSET, addtok():

	(1) incorrectly assumes that the character set being added to be added
	    is the one most (addtok has no argument to indicate which cset is
	    being added, so it just uses the latest one)

	(2) attempts to do some token sequence expansion into more primitive
	    operators so things like [FOO] are matched efficiently.

	Both of these assumptions are incorrect in the case that addtok()
	is being called from copytoks(): (1) is simply not true, and
	(2) is redundant--the expansion has already been done token sequence
	being copied, so there is no need to do the expansion again.

	The correct function to add exactly one token, without further expansion,
	is addtok_mb().  So here is my proposed fix, which is that copytoks()
	should never call addtok(), but instead directly call addtok_mb()
	(which is what addtok() eventually calls).

	* src/dfa.c (copytoks): Rewrite using addtok_mb directly.

	grep -i: work also when converting to lower-case inflates byte count
	Commit v2.12-16-g7aa698d addressed the case in which the lower-case
	representation of an input byte occupies fewer bytes than the original.
	However, even with commit v2.12-20-g074842d, grep -i would still
	misbehave when converting a character to lower-case increased its
	byte count.  The map-manipulation code assumed that the case conversion
	could only shrink the byte count.  With the consideration that it may
	also inflate it, the deltas recorded in the map array must be signed,
	and we must account for the one-to-two-or-more mapping when the
	original-to-lower-case conversion causes the byte count to increase.
	* src/searchutils.c (mbtolower): When a lower-case character occupies

	tests: extend coverage of dfa.c's match_mb_charset
	Add a test case to increase test coverage of part of dfa.c (the DFA
	matcher used by grep and gawk).  While thinking about removing the few
	remaining uses of strncpy in dfa.c, I found that none of the existing
	tests covered the 40+ lines of code at the end of match_mb_charset,
	so constructed this test case to demonstrate that it's not dead code
	* tests/dfa-coverage: New test, for improved coverage.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2012-06-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: fix a subtly twisted "make distcheck" failure
	"make distcheck" would fail when, during a test build,
	an attempt to overwrite the deliberately-write-protected
	$(srcdir)/grep.pot file would fail.
	* bootstrap.conf (bootstrap_epilogue): Don't let the existence of
	a large sparse file in the build directory induce "make distcheck"
	failure.  The existence of a large sparse test file named 8T-or-so
	would make po/Makefile.in.in's use of grep (to search for "GNU grep"
	as an indication that this is a GNU package) exit 2 without generating
	any output, which made the first xgettext use --package-name=grep,
	while that same search for "GNU grep" would succeed when run
	from a pristine from-tarball build, thus making the second
	xgettext invocation use --package-name='GNU grep'.
	That mismatch:
	-"Project-Id-Version: grep 2.12.18-1080\n"
	+"Project-Id-Version: GNU grep 2.12.18-1080\n"
	led to the attempt by Makefile.in.in's grep.pot-update rule to
	overwrite ../../grep.pot in the read-only po/ source directory.

2012-06-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	grep: fix how -i works with a match containing the Turkish I-with-dot
	Fix a long-standing problem in the way grep's -i interacts with
	data whose byte count changes when we convert it to lower case.
	For example, the UTF-8 Turkish I-with-dot (İ) occupies two bytes,
	but its lower case analog, i, occupies just one byte.  The code
	converts both search string and the haystack data to lower case,
	and then searches for the modified string in the modified buffer.
	The trouble arose when using a lowercase buffer <offset,length>
	pair to manipulate the original (longer) buffer.

	The solution is to change mbtolower to return additional information:
	a malloc'd mapping vector.  With that, the caller maps the lowercase-
	relative <offset,length> to numbers that refer to the original buffer.
	This mapping is used only when lengths actually differ, so the cost
	in general should be small.

	* src/searchutils.c (mbtolower): Add the new map parameter.
	* src/search.h (mb_case_map_apply): New function.
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Update mbtolower caller, and upon
	success, apply the new map.
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute): Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove turkish-I from this list;
	that test is no longer expected to fail.

	1. Diagnose too-large repeat counts rather than treating them as
	literal characters.  2. Use RE_INVALID_INTERVAL_ORD, not
	RE_NO_BK_BRACES, to decide whether to treat invalid-syntax {...}s
	as literals.  3. Use the same wording for {...}-related

	* src/main.c (struct color_cap): fct now returns void,
	since there's no longer need to use what it returns.
	(color_cap_mt_fct, color_cap_rv_fct, color_cap_ne_fct): Return void.
	(parse_grep_colors): Do not output diagnostics and then exit with
	status 0.  Instead, ignore errors in GREP_COLORS.  This is more
	consistent with programs that (e.g.) ignore errors in termcap entries,
	and it's more internally-consistent as some GREP_COLORS errors
	were ignored but not others.

	grep: exit with nonzero status if directory loop
	* src/main.c (grepdir): Exit with status 2 if a directory loop is
	found, since the output might not be "right" (i.e., infinite...).

	grep: suppress read errors if -s
	* src/main.c (reset, grep, grepfile): Do not report an input error
	if -s is given.

	grep: don't say "write error" over and over

	after the first one.  Use the same wording for the diagnostic

	* src/dfa.c (alloc_position_set): New function, use it throughout.

	dfa: use a more compact data type for grps
	* src/dfa.c (leaf_set): New.

	grep: -r with no args now searches "."
	This is a patch I've been meaning to put in for years.
	When I added support for "grep -r", I forgot to have "grep -r PAT"
	search the working directory by default, instead of searching
	standard input (which makes no sense, even if stdin is a directory).
	This is not an upward compatible change, since "grep -r PAT <file"
	will no longer search standard input, but that's OK; nobody should
	be using "grep -r" that way anyway.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/grep.texi (File and Directory Selection, grep Programs, Usage):
	Likewise.
	* src/main.c (usage): Likewise.
	(grepdir): If DIR is null, search the working directory, but do
	not prepend "./" to the file names.
	(main): If recursing and no operands are given, search ".".
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add r-dot.
	* tests/r-dot: New file.

	grep: prefer fgets to printf, _ to gettext
	* lib/colorize.h (print_end_colorize):
	* lib/ms/colorize-impl.c (print_end_colorize):
	Use fputs instead of printf.
	* src/main.c (usage): Likewise.  Use _ instead of gettext.

2012-01-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	grep: check stdin like other files
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/main.c (grepfile): Revamp tests for input files so that
	standard input is tested like other files.  For example, report
	an error if standard input equals standard output.
	Prefer open+fstat to stat+open if possible, as open+fstat is
	usually a bit faster and avoids a race condition.
	* tests/in-eq-out-infloop: Add tests for cases like
	'grep pat <file >>file'.

	(hstdout, norm_attr, w32_console_init, w32_sgr2attr)
	(w32_clreol) [__MINGW32__]: Move to lib/ms/colorize-impl.c.

	colorize module; caller changed.
	(should_colorize): Move to colorize module.

	grep: do input==output check more like dir loop check
	* src/main.c (grepfile): Just use SAME_INODE; don't bother
	with SAME_REGULAR_FILE.  This works better on properly-working
	POSIX hosts, since it handles the case where the file is changing
	as we grep it.  It works worse on hosts that don't support st_ino
	properly, but in practice this isn't that much of a problem here.
	* src/system.h (same_file_attributes, SAME_REGULAR_FILE):
	Remove; no longer needed.

	don't ignore errors when reading a directory
	grep no longer silently suppresses errors when reading a directory

	Problem reported as an aside by Bob Proulx (Bug#10355).
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/main.c (grep, grepfile): Implement this.  Simplify the code

	--include etc. now work on command-line args more consistently
	--include and --exclude apply only to non-directories and

	do not reject "grep -qr . > out"
	The recent fix to avoid an infinite disk-filling loop, commit 5e20a38a,
	introduced a minor regression.  If you use grep with -q and -r, and
	redirect output to a file that will be traversed, then grep would
	reject the command, even though it will generate no output.
	In that case, there is no risk of an infinite loop.

	not single quotes.  Spotted by Bruno Haible.
	This and the preceding change do not resolve the XPASS failure
	on OpenBSD 4.9 after all.  See the explanation at
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.grep.bugs/4022

	tests: avoid unwarranted test failure on *BSD-based systems
	* tests/word-delim-multibyte (e_acute): Use a more portable
	representation of e-acute.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

2011-11-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: accommodate -Wdeclaration-after-statement, but only in dfa.c,
	and because doing so does not impact readability/maintainability.
	This is solely to accommodate gawk users who are stuck with ancient gcc.
	This is no excuse to change any other code in grep.
	* src/dfa.c (dfaoptimize, parse_bracket_exp): Move declaration
	to precede first statement in block.

	Improved by Stefano Lattarini.

	tests: make the replacement export function more robust
	* tests/Makefile.am (sed_quote_value): Also quote single quotes.

2011-10-10  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: support development version of automake too
	This change implements a more correct and idiomatic use of the
	features of the Automake-provided 'parallel-tests' harness.
	Moreover, this change is required in order for the testsuite to
	continue to work with the new testsuite harness that is planned
	to be introduced in Automake 1.12 (which, as of the writing date,
	is still under development and in late alpha state).

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): The development version of
	automake dos not support setting the interpreter delegated to run
	the tests scripts in this variable; instead, use ...
	(LOG_COMPILER): ... this variable.
	* .gitignore: Ignore `.trs' files in directory `tests/'.
	* build-aux/.gitignore: Ignore `test-driver' script.

2011-07-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: add a test to trigger the bug
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	* tests/in-eq-out-infloop: Exercise the bug/fix.

	exit 2 (rather than infloop) when an input file is also on stdout
	This avoids a potential "infinite" disk-filling loop.
	Reported in http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?5316

	* src/main.c: Include "quote.h".

	dfa: change semantics of REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY's 3rd parameter
	* src/dfa.c (REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY): Change meaning of 3rd param,
	from "maximum index" to 1 greater than that: the required number
	of *P-sized elements.  Note that only some of the uses of
	REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY needed to be adjusted, the others had already
	required an extra element.

	dfa: rename REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY param/local for clarity
	* src/dfa.c (REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY): Rename nalloc and new_nalloc
	to n_alloc and new_n_alloc.

	dfa: prepare for a semantic change in REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY
	* src/dfa.c (REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY): Remove "t" (type) parameter.
	Use (*p) instead.  Adjust all callers.

	dfa: add braces to REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY definition
	* src/dfa.c (REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY): Add curly braces; use TABs

2011-06-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dfa: fix the root cause of the heap overrun
	dfa's "insert" function was supposed to be maintaining the position
	list sorted on *decreasing* index, but since the 2009-12-09 "Speed
	up insert" commit, 62458291, it was using code that assumed the data
	were sorted on *increasing* index.  As such, sometimes it would no
	longer merge constraints (not finding a match) and would append
	entries that normally would have matched and been merged.  Those
	erroneous append operations resulted in the heap overrun fixed by
	2011-06-17 commit 0b91d692 by doubling the array size.
	* src/dfa.c (insert): Fix the comparison.
	(dfaanalyze): Now that that's fixed, revert commit 0b91d692,
	allocating space for only d->nleaves entries, not double that.
	As far as I can tell, this change has no effect other than
	decreased memory usage, although it may improve performance
	slightly, since the resulting list of positions is half as long
	as it used to be.

2011-06-28  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: use memcpy to copy position_sets
	* src/dfa.c (copy): Use memcpy.

	dfa: use copyset to copy charclasses

	* .prev-version: Record previous version.

	build: avoid a warning when building with --disable-perl-regexp...
	and --enable-gcc-warnings.
	* src/pcresearch.c (WITHOUT_PCRE_NORETURN): Define.
	Remove the unreachable return statement.
	Reported by Eric Blake.

	tests: ensure that each test script is executable
	This adds a rule run at "make check" time to ensure that
	test scripts are consistently executable.
	This change is not required for "make check", but makes it easier
	for people to run scripts manually, but that is discouraged because
	doing so makes it easy to omit important variable settings that
	are normally provided via TESTS_ENVIRONMENT.
	This change also makes each of the existing TESTS executable.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check_executable_TESTS): New rule.
	(check): Depend on it.
	* tests/{all_scripts}: chmod 755.
	Prompted by a report from Eric Blake.

	maint: update bootstrap from gnulib
	* bootstrap: Update from gnulib.

	maint: update po/POTFILES.in
	* po/POTFILES.in: Remove dfasearch.c, now that it no longer
	contains a translatable diagnostic.

	tests: include-exclude: avoid false positive failure on FreeBSD
	* tests/include-exclude: Avoid false-positive failure due to
	matching "a" in a directory on FreeBSD, when searching a directory
	without "-r".  Search for '^aaa$' rather than just 'a'.
	Adjust test inputs and expected output files accordingly.

	dfa: remove some useless casts
	* src/dfa.c (icatalloc): Change type of "old" parameter
	from "char const *" to "char *".
	Don't cast-away const on realloc argument.
	Remove now-unnecessary const-discarding cast.
	Don't (void)-cast strcpy result.
	* src/dosbuf.c (undossify_input): Remove anachronistic
	cast-to-"char *" of realloc argument.

	dfa: more heap-allocation-related overflow protection
	* src/dfa.c (enlist): Use xnrealloc, not realloc.
	Also, remove unnecessary cast-to-(char *).
	(dfamust): Use xnmalloc, not malloc.  Before, this code would
	return upon malloc failure (xnmalloc exits upon failure), but
	later, via the *ALLOC macros, it could already exit, so this
	new potential exit point is nothing new.  The same applies
	to enlist, since it is called only through dfamust.

	tests: update init.sh; simplify TESTS_ENVIRONMENT
	* tests/init.sh: Update from coreutils.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove shell_or_perl_
	function.  Instead, just use $(SHELL), since grep has no test
	that starts with #!/usr/bin/perl.

	dfa: avoid possibility of overflow
	* src/dfa.c (REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY, CALLOC, MALLOC, REALLOC):
	Use functions from xalloc.h to avoid overflow.
	* src/dfasearch.c (GEAcompile): Use xnrealloc rather than realloc.
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pcompile): Use xnmalloc, not xmalloc.

2011-06-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	dfa: correct two uses of btowc
	* src/dfa.c (setbit_c, setbit_case_fold_c): Compare the btowc
	return value against WEOF, not EOF.  Suggested by Eli Zaretskii.
	On a system like MinGW with unsigned wint_t, comparing a btowc
	return value against EOF (-1) would always be false.

	dfa: don't overrun a malloc'd buffer for certain regexps
	* src/dfa.c (dfaanalyze): Allocate space for twice as many
	positions as there are leaves.  Before this change, for some
	regular expressions, DFA analysis would have inserted far more
	"positions" than dfa->nleaves (up to double).
	Reported by Raymond Russell in http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?33547

	dfa: process range expressions consistently with system regex
	The actual meaning of range expressions in glibc is not exactly strcoll,
	which makes the behavior of grep hard to predict when compiled with the
	system regex.  Leave to the system regex matcher the decision of which
	single-byte characters are matched by a range expression.

	This partially reverts a change made in commit 0d38a8bb (which made
	sense at the time, but not now that src/dfa.c is not doing multibyte
	character set matching anymore).

	* src/dfa.c (in_coll_range): Remove.

	dfa: fall back to glibc matcher if a MBCSET is found
	This patch enables full support of equivalence classes and multicharacter

	cases for multibyte grep.  Both of these changes however depend on the
	glibc version installed in the system.

2010-09-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	grep: diagnose and exit-2 for bogus REs like [:space:], [:digit:], etc.
	When I make a mistake like this:
	  grep '[:lower:]' ...
	be it in a script or on the command line, I want to know about
	it as soon as possible.  I don't want grep to print a mere warning
	that it is interpreting this suspicious and almost guaranteed-wrong
	regular expression as a set of just 6 bytes.  And I certainly don't
	want grep to silently do the wrong thing, even if that would be
	officially standards-conforming.  It's obvious that I intended
	[[:lower:]], and I want my error to be diagnosed in a way that is
	most likely to get my attention.  Thus, with this change, grep now
	prints a diagnostic and exits with status 2 the moment it
	encounters an offending [:char_class:] construct.

	This changes the way grep works by default, rather than
	putting this new behavior on an option.  A new option
	would seldom be used in scripts (not portable), and would
	probably be used only rarely by those who need it the most.
	This new functionality provides a valuable safety measure
	and incurs truly negligible risk.

	For strict POSIX compliance, set POSIXLY_CORRECT in
	your environment.  That disables this new feature.

	Revert the changes from commit 2cd3bcea, "grep: add
	--warnings={always,never,auto}.", and then do the following:

	* src/dfasearch.c (dfawarn): Call getenv("POSIXLY_CORRECT") here;
	Remove "warning: " from the diagnostic, now that it's more than
	a warning, and exit with status 2.
	* NEWS (New features): Describe the new semantics.
	* tests/warn-char-classes: Adjust one test to accommodate this change.
	* doc/grep.texi (Character Classes and Bracket Expressions): Document.

	* src/kwset.c (malloc) [GREP]: Define without the "(s)" macro
	parameter, so that unadorned uses of malloc are also mapped to xmalloc.
	One such use is in the expansion of obstack_init.

	Commit db9d6 would erroneously skip matches in SJIS character sets.  In

	Just as Perl prints nothing in this case,
	  printf '\357\274\241\n' | perl -CIO -lne '/\357/ and print'

	grep should also print nothing when used as follows.
	However, these would mistakenly match with grep prior to 2.6.2:
	  printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\357'

	grep -F: avoid infinite loop when searching for incomplete MB character
	Searching for an incomplete non-prefix of a multi-byte character

	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | perl -CIO -ne '/\274/ and print'

	  These should also print nothing, but with grep-2.6 and grep-2.6.1,
	  they would infloop:
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\241'
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\274'

	grep: split search.c
	* po/POTFILES.in: Update.
	* src/Makefile.am (grep_SOURCES, egrep_SOURCES, fgrep_SOURCES): Move

2010-03-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: use the fcntl-h module, not "fcntl"
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): We might need fcntl.h somewhere,
	but don't use the fcntl function.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	build: avoid link failure on systems using gnulib's fcntl but not open
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Using gnulib's fcntl module
	and including <fcntl.h>, but not also using gnulib's "open" module
	would result in link failure due to references to rpl_open
	on systems requiring the replacement (e.g., Cygwin and Darwin).

	build: avoid compilation failure on systems using rpl_open
	This new build failure has arisen as a result of using gnulib's
	"fcntl" module.  Now that an inadequate "open" syscall is replace
	by gnulib's wrapper, it is essential to include <fcntl.h>.
	* src/grep.c: Include <fcntl.h>.
	This is required, for grepfile's use of open, at least on
	Cygwin and Darwin.

	maint: use gnulib's fcntl module, just in case
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add fcntl.
	Grep uses at least O_BINARY, which may be defined therein.

	maint: remove TYPE_* definitions from src/system.h
	* src/system.h (TYPE_MAXIMUM, TYPE_MINIMUM, TYPE_SIGNED): Remove
	definitions.  They are provided by intprops.h.
	* src/grep.c: Include "intprops.h"
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add intprops.

	maint: alphabetize #include directives
	* src/grep.c: Alphabetize #include directives.

2010-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: stop using gnulib's memmove module
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove obsolete module: memmove

	build: reinstate gnulib's fcntl-h-tests
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_tool_option_extras): Do not avoid
	the fcntl-h-tests.  I cannot reproduce the failure.

2010-03-20  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	build: allow compilation on cygwin
	Gnulib is incompatible with -Wunused-macros.  Addtionally,
	cygwin 1.7.1 coupled with --enable-gcc-warnings tripped on:

	grep.c: In function 'print_line_middle':
	grep.c:805: error: array subscript has type 'char' [-Wchar-subscripts]
	grep.c: In function 'main':
	grep.c:1833: error: 'optarg' redeclared without dllimport attribute: previous dllimport ignored [-Wattributes]
	grep.c:1834: error: 'optind' redeclared without dllimport attribute after being referenced with dll linkage

	* configure.ac (GNULIB_WARN_FLAGS): Disable -Wunused-macros.
	* src/grep.c (print_line_middle): Use correct type to tolower.
	(main): Drop useless redeclarations.
	* .gitignore: Ignore more built files.

2010-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: ensure that all programs handle [b-a] consistently
	* tests/reversed-range-endpoints: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2010-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest
	This pulls in the latest regex module from gnulib, including a fix
	to make it honor the RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES syntax bit.

	tests: temporarily disable irrelevant-to-grep failing C++ fcntl-h-tests
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_tool_option_extras): Temporarily add
	--avoid=fcntl-h-tests, until the C++ part of that test is fixed.

2010-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	reject reversed-endpoint ranges, with all regex variants
	* src/search.c: Add RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES to the syntax bits
	in three places, so that all of grep, egrep, and grep -E reject
	a range with reversed endpoints like '[b-a]'.  This is required,
	when using the latest version of gnulib's regex module, since it
	now honors the RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES flag, rather than acting as if
	it were always set.
	Based on a change by Matthew Burgess.

2010-03-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: correct macro parameter parentheses
	* src/dfa.c (FETCH_WC, FETCH): Parenthesize macro parameters.

2010-03-19  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	tests: change help-version to per-program functions
	* help-version: Change each *_args variable to a *_setup function.

	dfa: fix wchar_t/wint_t type mismatch
	* src/dfa.c (FETCH_WC): Pass a local wchar_t variable to mbrtowc.
	(FETCH): Rename temporary second argument to FETCH_WC.
	(parse_bracket_exp): Always use FETCH_WC.

2010-03-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: add README-prereq, referenced from README-hacking
	* README-prereq: New file.  Cloned from coreutils, s/coreutils/grep/
	Reported by Tony Abou-Assaleh.

2010-03-19  Arnold Robbins  <arnold@skeeve.com>

	maint: sync dfa comments from gawk
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa) [newlines]: Amend comment.
	* src/dfa.c: Update copyright year list to include gawk's.

	maint: remove obsolete "cvs-clean" make target
	* Makefile.am (cvs-clean): Remove obsolete target.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: initialize struct mbcset using memset
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp): Use memset to initialize workmbc.

	dfa: spell out "unsigned int"
	* dfa.c (setbit, tstbit, clrbit, setbit_case_fold, lex, dfaoptimize,
	free_mbdata): Put "int" after unsigned.
	* dfa.h (struct position, struct dfa): Likewise.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: optimize simple character sets under UTF-8 charsets
	Only use a bitset when possible without involving MBCSET.  Testcase:
	   yes 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | sed 100000q | \
	     time grep -c [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,]

	Before: 51ms (best of three runs); after: 16ms(best of three runs).

	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp): For simple bracket expressions
	under UTF-8, use a CSET.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: speed up handling of brackets
	This patch has two sides.  One is to fold the parsing of brackets in the
	single- and multi-byte cases.  The second is to leverage this change,
	and use a bitset to test for single-byte characters in the charset.
	Splitting the two would be very hard.

	Testcase:
	   yes 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | sed 100000q | \
	     time grep -c [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,]

	Before: 59ms (best of three runs); after: 51ms (best of three runs).
	Nice, but mostly providing infrastructure for the next patch.

	* src/dfa.c (setbit_case_fold): Try applying towlower/towupper.
	(looking_at): Remove.
	(FETCH_WC): New.
	(fetch_wc): Merge into FETCH_WC [MBS_SUPPORT].
	(FETCH) [MBS_SUPPORT]: Call FETCH_WC.
	(prednames, find_pred, is_blank and other predicates): Move above,
	remove K&R syntax support.
	(parse_bracket_exp): New name of parse_bracket_exp_mb, rewritten to
	include single-byte character set parsing of brackets.
	(lex): Adjust for fetch_wc->FETCH_WC change, remove single-byte
	character set parsing of brackets.
	(match_mb_charset): Test against work_mbc->cset.
	* src/dfa.h (struct mb_char_classes): Add cset.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	syntax-check: remove space-tab exception
	* .x-sc_space_tab: Remove.
	* src/dfa.c: Fix space-tab occurrence.

	THANKS: fix Jim Meyering's email address
	* THANKS: Jim is now with Red Hat.

	dfa: add missing function
	* src/dfa.c (using_utf8): New.
	(addtok_wc, free_mbdata, dfaoptimize) [!MBS_SUPPORT]: Do not define.
	(dfacomp) [!MBS_SUPPORT]: Do not call dfaoptimize.

	grep: remove more register keywords
	* dosbuf.c: Remove register keywords.
	* grep.c: Remove register keywords.
	* kwset.c: Remove register keywords.
	* search.c: Remove register keywords.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: run simple UTF-8 regexps as a single-byte character set
	This provides a speedup whenever fgrep is "almost" sufficient but
	not quite (e.g. grep ^abc).  This affects test cases such as
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29117, which are already worked around
	by the line-by-line matching patch c32c04; without that patch the
	speedup can reach 1000x even on non-contrived testcases.

	* src/dfa.c (dfaoptimize): New.
	(dfacomp): Call it.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	tests: fix syntax-check failures
	* tests/case-fold-backref: Use "foo" instead of "the".
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Remove trailing blanks.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	grep: remove check_multibyte_string, fix non-UTF8 missed match
	Avoid computing ahead something that can be computed lazily as efficiently
	(or more efficiently in the case of UTF-8, though this is left as TODO).
	At the same time, "soften" the rejection condition for matching in the
	middle of a multibyte sequence to fix bug 23814.

	Multibyte "grep -i" would still be very slow if it wasn't for the workaround
	patch c32c042 (grep: match multibyte charsets line-by-line when using -i,
	2010-03-08).

	* NEWS: Document bugfix.
	* src/search.c (check_multibyte_string): Rewrite as...
	(is_mb_middle): ... this.
	(EGexecute, Fexecute): Adjust.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add euc-mb.
	* tests/euc-mb: New testcase.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: cache MB_CUR_MAX for dfaexec
	* src/dfa.c (state_index, dfaexec): Use d->mb_cur_max.
	(dfainit): Initialize it.
	(free_mbdata): New, extracted out of dfafree.
	(dfafree): Use it.

	dfa: improve documentation of struct dfa
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa): Reword some comments.

	tests: factor name of output files into a variable
	* tests/case-fold-backref, tests/case-fold-char-class,
	tests/case-fold-char-range, tests/case-fold-char-type,
	tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Use a variable for the output filename,
	as it is common to the grep and compare invocations.

	tests: use different output files to simplify reading failed .log files
	* tests/case-fold-backref, tests/case-fold-char-class,
	tests/case-fold-char-range, tests/case-fold-char-type: Use a different
	name for each output file from grep.
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Likewise, and merge some grep invocations.

	tests: add another grep -i testcase, from bug 16179
	* tests/case-fold-backref: New.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2010-03-16  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: rewrite handling of multibyte case_fold lexing
	Let dfacomp do the folding to lowercase of multibyte input strings,
	and remove it from grep.c.  Input strings to kwset.c are still folded
	outside kwset.c, so we still need to do mbtolower in search.c.

	* NEWS: Document bugfixes.
	* .x-sc_cast_of_argument_to_free: Remove.
	* src/dfa.c (wctok, addtok_wc): New.
	(cur_mb_index, update_mb_len_index): Remove.
	(FETCH): Do not call it.
	(parse_bracket_exp_mb) [GREP]: Disable case-folding of ranges and
	characters.
	(addtok): Extract part to...
	(addtok_mb): ... this new function.
	(lex): Call fetch_wc in the main loop for MB_CUR_MAX > 1.  Return WCHAR
	for normal characters if MB_CUR_MAX > 1.
	(atom): Handle WCHAR instead of treating multibyte characters specially.
	Do case folding of multibyte characters here.
	(dfacomp): Remove case_fold special casing.
	* src/dfa.h (WCHAR): New.
	* src/grep.c (mb_icase_keys): Remove.
	(main): Do not call it.
	* src/search.c (kwsinit): Init transition table only for MB_CUR_MAX == 1.
	(mbtolower): New.
	(kwsincr_case): New.
	(kwsmusts): Call it instead of kwsincr.
	(check_multibyte_string): Remove.
	(check_multibyte_string_no_icase): Rename to check_multibyte_string.
	(GEAcompile, EGexecute, Fcompile): Use mbtolower instead of the old
	check_multibyte_string.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add case-fold-backslash-w.
	* tests/foad1.sh: Enable fixed tests.
	* tests/case-fold-backslash-w: New.

2010-03-16  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	grep: match multibyte charsets line-by-line when using -i
	The turtle combination -i + MB_CUR_MAX>1 requires case conversion ahead
	of time.  Avoid doing this repeatedly when many matches succeed.  Together
	with the previous changes, this fixes https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29117
	and https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?14472.

	* NEWS: Document new speedup.
	* src/grep.c (do_execute): New.
	(grepbuf): Use it.

2010-03-15  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: fix handling of ranges in multibyte character sets
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp_mb): Add separate ranges for
	lowercase and uppercase endpoints if folding case.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add case-fold-char-range.
	* tests/case-fold-char-range: New.

	tests: add more UTF-8 test cases
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add spencer1-locale.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add spencer1-locale.awk.
	* tests/spencer1-locale.awk: New.
	* tests/spencer1-locale: New.

2010-03-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: complete the renaming fedora.sh -> fedora
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Rename fedora.sh -> fedora here, too.

2010-03-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* tests/fedora.sh: Rename to...
	* tests/fedora: ...this, to reflect new convention:
	Use the lack of a suffix to indicate we've converted to the new
	init.sh-using test framework.

	tests: adjust fedora.sh to handle traps more portably

2010-03-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: adjust fedora.sh to handle traps more portably
	* tests/fedora.sh: Use "Exit", not "exit".

	tests: for each test, set an envvar to its name
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set GREP_TEST_NAME for
	each test.  This is used to help make the output of hundreds of
	independent, often-parallel valgrind runs more manageable.

2010-03-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: clean up fedora.sh
	* tests/fedora.sh: Use "grep", not ${GREP}.
	Use init.sh.
	Use timeout 10, not sleep 1 (three times).
	The latter would always sleep for 3 seconds, and the test would
	fail with a false positive on a slow system or with a heavily
	instrumented (valgrind) executable.

2010-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: avoid build failure with --enable-gcc-warnings
	* src/dfa.c: Don't include <assert.h>, now that it is not used.

	dfa, grep: cleanup if-before-free and cast-of-argument-to-free
	* .x-sc_avoid_if_before_free: Remove.

	* .x-sc_cast_of_x_alloc_return_value: Remove.
	* .x-sc_cast_of_argument_to_free: Temporarily add src/search.c.
	* cfg.mk (local-checks-to-skip): Remove sc_cast_of_argument_to_free.
	* src/dfa.c (ifree): Remove.
	(dfamust, build_state, transit_state, dfafree): Do not do if-before-free,
	do not cast free argument to ptr_t or char *.
	(freelist): Call free instead of ifree.
	* src/dfa.h (ptr_t): Remove.

2010-03-12  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: remove CRANGE dead code
	The only use of CRANGE was removed by commit 193830d.  In theory it is
	more correct to do what CRANGE did, but in practice it seems like it did
	not work.

	* src/dfa.h (token): Remove CRANGE.
	* src/dfa.c (atom): Do not handle CRANGE.
	(prtok): Likewise.

2010-03-12  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: get rid of x*alloc
	* src/dfa.c: Include xalloc.h.
	(xmalloc, xrealloc, xcalloc): Remove.

	grep: cleanup one const cast
	* src/search.c (GEAcompile): Do not reuse motif when operating on the
	(const) pattern, so we can make it non-const.  Remove cast from free.

	kwset/system: remove ptr_t
	* src/kwset.h: Declare kwset using an incomplete struct type.
	* src/system.h (ptr_t): Remove.

2010-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: add test cases for dfaexec bug
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	Reported by Paolo Bonzini in http://bugzilla.redhat.com/544407
	and http://bugzilla.redhat.com/544406 .

2010-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dfa: manually merge gawk's dfaexec
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Adjust API: return pointer, not offset, and
	take an "end" pointer parameter, rather than integral "size".
	Adjust comment accordingly.
	(build_state): Maintain d->newlines.
	(copytoks): Update multibyte_prop indices.
	(SKIP_REMAINS_MB_IF_INITIAL_STATE): Update a cast.
	Return NULL, rather than (size_t) -1.
	(realloc_trans_if_necessary): Realloc d->newlines.
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa): New member, "newlines".
	(struct dfa) [GAWK]: New member, "broken".
	(dfaexec): Update prototype and copy the new comment from dfa.c.

	dfa: make search.c use the new dfaexec API

	* src/search.c: Adjust to new dfaexec API.
	Now, dfaexec returns a pointer, not an integer,
	and the third parameter is END, not buffer size.
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Rewrite the function's comment.
	Don't just clobber *END.  While doing that happens to be
	fine for gawk's usage, in grep, *END usually points to the
	first byte of the next buffer.  Save the initial value,
	and restore it just before returning.
	* src/dfa.h (dfaexec): Update comment; include parameter names.

2010-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dfa: appease static analyzers
	* src/dfa.c (transit_state_singlebyte): Call abort rather
	than returning in a "can't happen" scenario.
	This stops clang from emitting a false-positive report (I think it
	was used-uninitialized) about a caller.

2010-03-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dfa: do not accept [[:UPPER:]] or [[:LOWER:]] internally
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp_mb): Those class names are not
	valid, and rejected elsewhere, so there is no point in allowing
	upper or mixed-case versions here.

2010-03-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: remove a trailing space
	* src/search.c (EXECUTE_FCT): Remove trailing space.

	maint: remove all uses of PARAMS

	Remove the remainder manually.

2010-03-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: remove all uses of PARAMS
	* lib/savedir.h (PARAMS): Remove definitions manually.
	Remove the remaining ones via this command:
	  git grep -l define.PARAMS |xargs perl -ni -e '/define PARAMS/ or print'
	* src/dfa.h (PARAMS): Remove definitions.
	* src/system.h (PARAMS): Likewise.
	Remove most uses with this:
	  git grep -lw PARAMS |xargs perl -pi -e 's/\bPARAMS *\((.*)\);/$1;/'
	Remove the remainder manually.

	maint: remove now-useless prototypes
	* src/dfa.c: Remove the prototype of each static, non-recursive
	function whose definition precedes first use.

	grep: plug an inconsequential leak
	* src/grep.c (main): Plug a leak: free "keys".

	grep: avoid useless allocations for empty GREP_OPTIONS
	* src/grep.c (prepend_default_options): Ignore GREP_OPTIONS
	when it's empty, not just when it's undefined.
	There are still relatively harmless leaks when GREP_OPTIONS

	to use both it and check_multibyte_string_no_icase.

	maint: avoid warnings about unused fwrite return value
